I also had the police come once, as we had a panic button that hung on the back of the office door... The only that opened to the lobby. Some homeless guy thought it was important, or valuable or something and took it while I was making coffee... Then pressed it.

Agnosticpagan,"Most trades are one asset to another. Money is just the clearing account for most the transaction. ForEx is purely monetary transactions, but the majority of that are short-term hedges against long-term contracts of an underlying asset (oil, wheat, steel, coffee, etc.)

I agree that capitalism is predicted on infinite growth, and thus unsustainable. Ironically, most bankers get that since they deal in credit far more than currency, and unlimited credit is not a good thing. The rest of finance?

eyecouldbeyou,"I don't have any advice to give you other than to say I feel your pain. My buddy that I have known practically all my life has a big (huge...about 9 inches as well) one and he always.....I mean ALWAYS.....hooks up with different women. 

Some of these women are even married and they tell him how her husband is not even half his size. As a friend I give him high five every time he gets laid but deep down inside I get this knot in my stomach. 

Being that I am only average in size I could be the guy where my wife cheats on me. Women always claim ""size doesn't matter"" (especially here on reddit) but I haven't met ANY of these women in real life. I hear it all the time how they say it does matter whether at work or a bar or over hearing women at a damn coffee shop (true story). 

Maybe it's the women I go for that say it matters. Yes I am a good looking man that wants a good looking girl. If anything it's the girls that aren't my type that maybe say size doesn't matter but these are girls that I wouldn't be able to get erect to. You understand what I mean?

Not only does he get constantly laid for his size but he also has had it good all his life. He doesn't know how it feels to struggle financially (like me). Things always seem to fall on his lap whereas I need to work hard to get a little something.

I've learned that some people just have it and some don't. Maybe in my previous life I was a porn star with a huge cock and tons of money or maybe it will be in my next life ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è but in this life not so much.

fkdkshufidsgdsk,"biggest piece of advice is to really preheat that brew chamber -put it in a silicon funnel in your kettle, cover it and leave it in there while the water boils and let it sit in there with the water boiling for a couple mins before you pull the shot. The pro takes longer to heat up than other models (but also holds its heat the best) My first shots I just followed the preheat instructions that came w the flair and the coffee came out tasting like battery acid lol.

also, get a WDT tool. I have a jx pro so ill assume the max is similar in that it clumps quite a bit, just kinda the nature of a conical hand grinder. WDT completely eliminates channeling for me, before even when I felt like my puck prep was perfect, I could get a spurt shooting out.

hva5hiaa,"With my prescription medication, I still 'want' to be asleep during the day. It just helps me push it off to the side. It is always looming and if I were to shut my eyes too long, I'd want to find a place to take a nap. There are researcher who think that hypersomnia patients are like gas/brake pedal. Normally you let up on the brake, step on the gas (medication/ stimulants/ adrenaline) and you rev your system up. When you step on the brake (calming down/ medication/ depressants) your heart rate slows, thoughts stop racing. With hypersomnia, the brake pedal is stuck. You can step on the gas, but you won't get anywhere fast. Thus I am 'awake' (not necessarily 'alert and normal')  and 'very sleepy' at the same time.

Medications can be chosen due how long they can stay in your system during the day, or formulated with time release so they keep your blood concentration up. Modafinil, for instance has a biological half life of 13 hours - ie 13 hours after taking it, half the concentration is still working in your body. The substances you mention have much shorter biological half lives, so the effects are too short to keep you awake as easily, even though you might still be feeling other effects. Everything, like caffeine, is the same - coffee drinkers titrate their blood levels by getting more throughout the day or else they get a 'crash.'

Alcohol has 'biphasic' effects - initially being excitatory, but then sedative. That's hard to keep at the right level and also not have the other affects of alcohol interfere with your daily activities. 

It is possible your metabolism is 'fast' as you mention, too. That half-life number can vary by hours, if your liver enzymes are better/ more of them at breaking down certain molecules. I can't take codeine as a medication - I still have great pain on a normal dose and family members with the same gene just get side effects and not relief. 

And of course, we're just random people on the internet, and not doctors. There are a lot of conditions which include excessive daytime sleepiness. It took months of blood tests, MRI, CT scans, spinal taps, psychologists, sleep tests, etc before tagging me with hypersomnia. My quality of life was so bad I was actually crushed when I was told that the Neurological Grand Rounds at Johns Hopkins said that semi-experimental brain surgery on a odd spot in my brain wouldn't help my sleepiness. It could be your problem is easier to fix, so I hope you are able to find a specialist who will really take the time to listen to you and help. 

It took three different medications to get me to the level of 'feeling like it is always 5 am' instead if 'always feeling like I've been awake for 3 days straight' so it might unfortunately, be hard to find an answer with non-medical substances. Being uncontrollably sleepy is devastating.",1643289243,hufnfdf,1,Narcolepsy,2022-01-27T13:14:03Z

xmacv,"Just some random thoughts as I drink morning coffee:

* **Improve any branding or image the club has**
   * Professional looking logos
   * Other visual assets (colors, icons, etc.)
   * Just strive for consistency - come up with a visual that works and use it, a lot (FB, instagram, etc)
* **Find someone in your club who is good at this stuff**
   * Good photographer or good with digital imaging
   * Good at setting up a website and maintaining it
* In today's day and age, **I don't think iPhone pics really cut it**. So many people are able to produce insanely high quality content with budget gear (entry level mirrorless cameras for ex) You really need to focus on good looking content for it to reach that next level.

**What about the content itself?**

I think this is the hardest part.

Anything happen within the club is something to promote!

* League night? Take tonnes of 'higher quality' photos of the action - overlay your branding on the images and drop an instagram post with 10 pictures / same on Facebook
* Did a younger player compete in a tournament? Post a story about them, with high quality images, etc.
* Upcoming tournaments? Promote the crap out of it - again, high quality visuals/posters, branding.
* Create content that would appeal to a younger audience. Benefits of squash - exercise, healthy lifestyle, social elements, etc.
   * Although I will admit, squash is still very niche and not something that people just really '*pickup*'.",1643289218,hufndj2,1,squash,2022-01-27T13:13:38Z

WaffleStomperGirl,"Yes. Very common. As someone who has lived in Canada, US, Aus, and NZ, it‚Äôs very common for someone to only say exactly what they want. 

Though it is worth recognizing the nuances in the body language that can differ between polite and impolite. 

For example, someone staring down at their phone when they get to the counter, not bothering to look up, and saying in a half dismissive tone ‚Äúsmall coffee‚Äù is considered impolite, and quite rude. 

But you can say the same words with a cheerful attitude, smile, and courteous nod to the barista, and this is considered polite and warm. 

One main area of etiquette that requires more words is when you receive your order, if the person does not say thank you at all, they‚Äôre being very rude.

RTheD77,"I spiraled after a break up several years ago. She dumped me and I wasn‚Äôt expecting it. But if I had read the signs I would have known it was coming. I was three months away from making the decision if I was going to marry her (I wanted to really think about it in the new year). My perception is that we as men assume since there aren‚Äôt arguments that everything is fine, but really it‚Äôs sometimes because the other person is really thinking about his or her thoughts about the future that they have sort of been considering their future too. There are always tells and looking back there were many. I realized that the year after when I would occasionally think about the relationship. It became clear to me I was trying to force a square peg into a round hole: me coming from a background where money was tight and I was doing really well financially to her, where money wasn‚Äôt even a concern because her family was rich but she couldn‚Äôt make any decent money on her own. She was also going through a crisis of faith while I was confident in my spirituality. Hers was performative, mine was my identity. I was an introvert and she was an attention seeker. 

Had I paid attention more I could have prevented some of the whiplash and I learned from it. The best thing I did was drink a cup of coffee any time I felt myself getting down, and then go for a bike ride or a run. Instead of spending time at home alone, I‚Äôd spend hours in the gym. Then I planned vacations, spending a month in South America and a month in Europe. Before long I forgot how to feel depressed but I also realized I could have done way better than I did, and learned to be responsible in my pursuits. I realized that if I had met her as a friend I wouldn‚Äôt have wanted to be friends, and that friendship is more important than attraction. Mental health is often tied to the people we interact with on a daily basis and if they aren‚Äôt helping you get better, you‚Äôre going to be more annoying to them in turn.

I actually find physical touch calms me greatly (hugging, hand hold,etc) IF it is coming from the (small) circle of people I really trust. In the heat of the moment, I usually need to work through the shame of being upset.

iDemonicAngelz,"Since it's for the community, I will give my thoughts although I did PM you. 

For Engineer, the new fourth bonus should make it fun again because it resembles the Exodia concept kinda from YugiOh if you ever played that. Otherwise the 3rd bonus with time machine is the way to go past i10 from what I can tell. Regarding strats, you want to try and go infinite with Sentinel rare and just spam Robo hounds. Robowitch and Iron Colossus for armor and armored plus the robot tags. Avoid overcharged although I generally get a Wizard III. The key trick is the new Ancient Azhar (strictly better than the clunky sphere of duplication (robot tag!) strat most high inferno users were relying on). Done correctly, you only need one of each card (Sentinel, Iron Colossus) to create a semi infinite combo with Azhar. If you get Key to the Portal skill, you go infinite. With all the robots tags in your deck, it scales very fast and can sometimes be a OTK. 

The other reliable and much easier strat to setup is Robot Burn similar to Shaman burn build those better than me have found. Usually same cards you always go for any Engineer run but if you dont get the classic Sentinel or iron Colossus,  you can try for a 1-2x Flamethrower. Use the new fire Demon ancient rare Megalorth I believe it's called (Tad tired, need coffee) that the Shaman burn build uses to scale the burn extremely fast. 

You want the classic defensive skills to setup the first turn or two against the enemies too. Think Frost Nova, Freezing Shot, Ice Block, Invisible Potion, etc. These allow you the breathing room to go infinite.

And as others have said and I have posted many times, when in doubt take a gem and heal. Transform a card. Remove a card. Sometimes it gets boring but generally a class either wants to go infinite (Wizard Fairies, Shaman Blesse Fairy Angels, etc) or wants a slim deck (4 cards ideally with tons of exile to get there) and abusing Circulsr shield. 

Have fun. Good luck!",1643289062,hufn2lq,1,RogueAdventure,2022-01-27T13:11:02Z

SuitableGuarantee968,I'm so sorry you're having to deal with this as well as acid reflux at the same time. I had just cured my gastritis when I had to start supplementing again so maybe this little bit will help . Let me guess the supplements you picked up are ferrous sulfate correct? That's what doctors tend to prescribe and that tends to be the most problematic for our stomachs especially if one is dealing with GERD. May I recommend that you change to Ferrous bisglycinate which is a lot calmer on the stomach. Blood Builders is the best and even my OBGYN swears by it or if you do not want the B vitamins you can get a generic bisglycinate. The reason I recommended bisglycinate is because it is taken up very well by the body. Cut down on your milk and tea and coffee around the time of your supplements.

singularity48,"On par with my special interest, I worked at airports many times. One in which I was an aircraft fueler. Aside from the rather shitty work environment, I liked it out of most because I was free to do my job without customers or managers down my back constantly. I was free to be around what I liked without having the soulless nature of the job bleed me dry. It did eventually which is simply a side effect of American work culture.

Because the breaks were around an hour long, I'd chose to walk the mile long terminal while listening to music and drinking coffee. It got me away from the gossip and negative nature of the people that I worked with.

My first job was a grocery store stocking produce. I didn't mind it as I wasn't dealing with customers on a regular basis. The jobs I wouldn't recommend would be factory labor. Which of course is all I'm surrounded with now. If you really like being treated as an expendable robot, that's were you go.",1643289017,hufmzih,1,aspergers,2022-01-27T13:10:17Z

Brainkey,"&gt;And stem-cells are not human will not grow into an adult on their own, they need to be specifically modified for it to be so.

By this logic a fetus will not grow into an adult without being specifically birthed after developing enough, which means if a fetus isn't able to survive delivery then it isn't going to be an adult either.

&gt;I would equate personhood with humanity

A human and a person are not necessarily the same thing, if you met an alien with the exact intelligence of a human but they're not biologically considered homo sapiens then they're not humans but they'd still be people, just extra-terrestrial people. And I'm sure you'd also feel what you feel towards murder if a human person killed one of these alien people, unless what you truly value in humanity is our DNA which makes absolutely no sense because.

The problem with killing people isn't necessarily that you kill their human-meat-vehicle, but that you stop their consciousness from existing. An alien person would have an equivalent consciousness so killing them would be just as bad.

In fact we had similar organisms on Earth, Neanderthals. They could speak, they could sing, they made paintings, they developed tools, they were probably as intelligent our prehistoric ancestors and they reproduced with Homo Sapiens in Europe and Asia who then spread their genes to the rest of humanity. They weren't humans, as humans are Homo Sapiens.

If you had a huge guy with a huge brow and fat fingers be killed on the street you would definitely say they were murdered, and that they weren't an animal they were a person. It wouldn't matter if they weren't human they were still a member of society and they talked about how they liked their coffee black and how hard it is for him to find shoes for his big feet and maybe they weren't the smartest fellow but so what they were still a person.

Personhood isn't exclusive to humans. If personhood isn't a word that means humans, then a fetus isn't a person just because it is human.",1643288897,hufmrfz,1,europe,2022-01-27T13:08:17Z

Richard Osman: paid for a chocolate bar as the train was arriving, and I fumbled his change in a rush as we were short of notes. Was nice enough about it but was probably more concerned about missing his train.

Kevin McLoud: met him on two occasions and he had peppermint tea on both. We had a friendly exchange about something or other and he seemed polite and friendly.

Charlie Wernham: was another semi-regular and seemed like a normal Essex lad in his early 20s.

Jonathan Goodwin: just bought something and went on his way. Didn't really interact with him beyond saying the price.

And what do we have here? A Cadenhead picked and vatted Benrinnes that was made up of 3 ex-Bourbon Hogsheads, released under a favourite (now gone) label of Small Batch, all at cask strength. This could be what I‚Äôm looking for to really change my mind.

Did it? Let‚Äôs find out, shall we?

**Price:** ‚Ç¨ 126

**Region:** Speyside

**Vintage:** 1995

**Bottled:** March 2019

**Cask types:** Made up of 3 ex-Bourbon Hogsheads

**Number of bottles:** 708

**Abv** 51.1%

**Colour:** 2.5Y 7/8 

**Nose:** Apple, floral, orange varnish, cardamom

Fruity, and then this strong chemical note. It‚Äôs very shy at first, then it‚Äôs all fruit and more fruit with some floral/spice at the side.

Water brings out the spice, and it‚Äôs needed. As it stands? Not doing too much, just okay.

**Taste:** Nectarine, mineral, floral, mint

More stone fruit, mineral, and floral aspect. The more I have this whisky, the more I compare it to the one above, and feel better about guessing about the sherry influence above.

This is more of the standard notes that Benrinnes has. Sadly it‚Äôs just those, with little else coming from it. You‚Äôre not going to get big mint energy from it. Just medium mint energy, like an After Eight that is having self-confidence issues and keeps comparing itself to Trebor mints, which it shouldn‚Äôt but no one has ever taught it good boundaries and that‚Äôs where it‚Äôs demons lay now.

**Finish:** Basil, vanilla, orange, ginger

Herbal, some nice heat, orange, and one of the casks (at least) decided to show up and add something.

It‚Äôs like a gas station dessert at this point. The flavours are muted, but they are there, and it‚Äôs fine. Maybe more like a British coffee shop dessert, now that I think about it.

**Conclusion:** Just an okay whisky. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd be annoyed at buying this if you knew what Benrinnes does. It reminds me of a slightly better Lowland whisky. Or perhaps you want something to start off the dinner that won‚Äôt impact the rest of it.

As a 23-year-old Benrinnes, it‚Äôs hard to reconcile the lack of complexity with the quality of the dram. It‚Äôs fine to just have a dram at a bar, and I think that‚Äôs where I‚Äôd recommend trying it before buying it (after the pandemic is over, so a few years from writing this probably).

Did it change my mind on ex-Bourbon Benrinnes? Not at all, if anything, it reinforced the narrative, which is too bad. Oh well, guess I‚Äôll have to keep trying more to change my mind. What a rough life (this is sarcasm).

**77/100**

Teslatroop,"Checking voltages is the most common application. You can check to see if voltage is present at a device, if it isn't, look at the prints and work your way backwards until you find the open circuit. Or if a PLC is turning an output on, you can check the voltage at the output. When there is voltage present, you can turn around and blame the electrician/mechanic for the issue and go back to your office to drink coffee.

Checking continuity is helpful when determining if a conductor is connected at both points A and B.

If you have a clamp on amp meter, it's helpful for checking if a motor is working too hard (drawing a lot of current).

One thing to consider is when measuring current, your meter will act as a short. So if you put your probes in parallel to a device, you will short that circuit out (and most likely blow the fuse in your meter).",1643288358,huflqxv,1,PLC,2022-01-27T12:59:18Z

greendesk,"Generally, my weekday mornings go something like this:

My alarm goes at 7 o'clock and my wake-up light is at full brightness at 7:10. I  snooze 7-7:10 thinking about my plans for the day, try to finish the dream I was having, or just lie there feeling cosy (having a regular wake-up time is important). Then I drink a few big gulps of water (wakes me up) and do 2 duolingo lessons in bed. After that, I go out of bed or I read some messages or news and then go out of bed. 

Once I get up, I do a 6 minute mobility exercise (YouTube follow-along) and/or 50 pushups and 50 reps of ab exercise (usually bicycles). After that I go to the bathroom, wash my face, brush my teeth, make coffee and do simple things until I feel awake enough for work (like tidying up, doing laundry, or reading). Around 8 o'clock I start working from home or leave for work (which is a 5 minute walk). Between 9 and 11 I have breakfast, depending on when I get hungry. If I go to work, I made my food yesterday evening.

I came to this morning routine through years of small adaptations, trying out what fits me and adapting to changing life situations (like home office). I plan to trial changing my morning routine to include more sports soon :)

Hope this gives some inspiration :)",1643288255,huflk0a,1,getdisciplined,2022-01-27T12:57:35Z

wrylashes,"To keep it up for long, it is important to still have a good balance of food.  i.e. have those veggies and fruits and whole grain cereals (fibre helps keep your digestive system healthy).  

A really easy way to add calories is to increase fat consumption (fat is super calorie dense), but do ramp that up gradually as too fast an increase often causes digestive issues.  Heavy cream is famous in the community for how well it can help pack on the pounds (mix some with chocolate syrup or use it in a milkshake, add some regularly to coffee or tea, use it in cooking, etc).

Obviously another way to pack in calories is sugar, but having a lot of sugar can cause blood sugar spikes and crashes that can leave a lot of people not feeling great.  Presumably she isn't close to being diabetic so she can probably handle extra sugar for a while, but even so pigging out on a lot of sweets may not leave her feeling great.  Buffering the system with high fibre and high fat food first can help slow down the sugar rush, but still don't overdo it.  (that said, the body doesn't really register water-like sweet liquids as calories, so for example a glass of apple juice won't make you feel any more full or sated than a glass of water, so it can be a way to add just that bit of extra calories in at the end of a meal)

It is always cheaper, and generally healthier, to make food at home compared to ordering out.  Of course it can be a lot of fun to pull into three drive-thrus in a row and get food at each, or grab a dozen donuts on a road trip, and having fun is important!  But I'd suggest aiming for the bulk of her calories to come from the grocery store rather than from fast food.  Maybe a little bit slower, but more sustainable.

The other good thing about the grocery store is that you can easily look at the nutrition information on what you are buying.  Check the calorie content and how much fat, fibre, and sugar there is, and you can quickly figure out what has a lot of calories without being just sugar.

And most of all, remember that the goal is to have fun in the process, not to gain at all costs.  Don't stuff her more than she is comfortable with, figure out her eating style (lots of snacks vs big meals, morning vs evening, etc), and make sure that she feels loves and adored as she is doing it :)",1643288213,huflh6f,1,WeightGainTalk,2022-01-27T12:56:53Z

Ragdoll_Proletariat,"Do you thank your wife for picking your socks up, too?

CS Lewis has an interesting idea about gendered attitudes to selfishness. For men, he argues that a man thinks he is being unselfish if others aren't made to take trouble for him whereas women think unselfishness is taking trouble for others.

When you don't pick your socks up, the result of that will eventually be that you don't have socks. Your wife will still have socks regardless of whether you pick yours up or not. However, because of that gendered idea, your wife is more likely to take on that extra work because to leave your socks in place would seem selfish even though you have never asked her to do it for you.

While I'm sure she is glad that you listen to her, thanks does come with the implication that you made something easier for her, which in turn indicates that she feels it's something she has to do for you if you don't do it. In that context, thanks can be read as, ""I accept that picking the socks up was my responsibility and not yours, and that you did it for me to benefit me rather than because you needed it doing."" That, in itself, is not a fair agreement because the flip side of that is that, if you did run out of socks, it would then be her fault. 

I might thank my partner for making me a cup of coffee but I wouldn't thank him for making himself a cup of coffee.",1643288188,huflfj0,1,changemyview,2022-01-27T12:56:28Z

Dafugisgoinon,"We know from yogis and mystics and gurus that have transcended this. We know from surgeons who have witnessed hundreds of people return from the dead with experiences that took place while the brain was inactive. We know this from psychedelics and ego death. DMT illustrates this perfectly. Ketamine detaches consciousness from the body.

Its clear to anyone who has transcended the mind that consciousness is not produced by a brain. At the very least it is an antenna, an electro-chemical antenna that receives consciousness. 

On salvia you can become a coffee cup or a piece of granite for eternity. On 5meo DMT you become god and gain omniscience.

How do we know? Experientially. The data is out. Many remarkable scientists have pushed the envelope on this understanding and left modern science behind. We have telescopes to peer into the nature of reality and consciousness and most mainstream scientists are too afraid to look in the fucking microscope because it will shatter their materialistic world view.",1643288145,huflcqo,1,nonduality,2022-01-27T12:55:45Z

If we were in the wild, I would attack you. Even if you weren't in my food chain, I would go out of my way to attack you. If I were a lion, and you were a tuna, I would swim out in the middle of the ocean and freaking eat you! And then I'd bang your tuna girlfriend.

Gamble:
[pause] Okay, first off, a lion swimming in the ocean? Lions don't like water. If you'd placed it near a river or some sort of fresh water source, that'd make sense. But you find yourself in the ocean, 20-foot waves, I'm assuming it's off the coast of South Africa, coming up against a full-grown, 800-pound tuna with his 20 or 30 friends? You lose that battle. You lose that battle nine times out of ten. And guess what? You've wandered into our school of tuna, and we now have a taste of lion. We've talked to ourselves. We've communicated.

Hoitz:
Yeah?

Gamble:
And said, ""You know what? Lion tastes good. Let's go get some more lion."" We've developed a system to establish a beachhead and aggressively hunt you and your family. And we will corner your pride, your children, your offspring...

Hoitz:
How you gonna do that?

Gamble:
We will construct a series of breathing apparatus with kelp. We will be able to trap certain amounts of oxygen. It's not gonna be days at a time, but an hour, hour 45, no problem. That will give us enough time to figure out where you live, go back to the sea, get more oxygen, and then stalk you. You just lost at your own game. You're outgunned and outmanned.

Yesterday was a bit of a rolling poopfest. Bad news after bad news....bad weigh in to start the day (up weight??), officially went out on a potential new home, Dr appt didn't go well, work was work etc. Then it started to turn around after I got home. Got good news regarding our current home, got a great workout in on the bike, made chicken picatta for dinner, watched The Alpinist on netflix then got to bed under calories.

**Thursday:**

Breaking my rules on weigh ins (2 spaced out weigh ins a week, always in the morning after using the bathroom) to weigh myself this morning and my suspicions were confirmed...yesterday was an abnormally high weigh in. Down 1.6lbs from yesterday and under 190 for the first time since last Spring! Today's more of the same. Early lift before work, bike after work. Making NY strip steaks for dinner and finishing the Avengers is the goal!

Getting a little pissy about my weight staying in the high 160s after being back on a deficit for a month. Why is my body rebelling against losing weight? Stress? Inflammation? Who the fuck knows? I'm feeling the time crunch because I wanted to be back in 150s before I have surgery. It doesn't look like that's going to happen so it's affecting the Brain Weasels. 

Hey, did you all realize how long commercial breaks are these days? I knew I needed to some kind of activity but didn't want to risk hurting my back more with a kettlebell so I decided to do some step ups while the news was on. So every time it cut to commercials, I would start stepping. Did that the whole time the news was on. So many more commercials than I remember. üò≥ü•¥üòÜ

&gt;!The Hopper is available in Mr. Qi's Walnut room on Ginger Island. Basically, you set it behind a ""machine"" (keg, furnace, oil maker, etc.) and load it up with whatever the machine processes and it will automatically refill the machine whenever you harvest a finished item.!&lt;

&gt;!I had a ton of coffee beans saved up (like, 7000...), so I set up 3 hoppers with kegs in a spot on the farm I tend to pass by 3-5 times a day and filled them with my bean stash.!&lt; 

&gt;!Now I can grab 3 coffees whenever I happen to pass by, the hoppers refill the kegs for me, and there are 3 more when I pass by again an hour later. I usually end up getting ~9 a day. It's fairly passive coffee accumulation, and I love not having to interrupt my wine production to do a coffee kegging day every month or three.!&lt; 

Also, since you didn't mention it, the buffs for drinks stack on top of the buffs for food, so if you eat a food with a speed boost (i.e. Pepper Poppers, Crab Cakes) and also drink a coffee, you get a double speed boost.

I know I want the thing, I know I'll get a lot of use out of it, but the idea of dropping ¬£1500 on something all at once is very uncomfortable regardless.  


That ""pulling the trigger"" block is a doozy.  


So I psych myself up, make sure there isn't a better option out there to make me regret this choice, and then push the button to buy.  


Then it's out of my hands, ""too late to change my mind"" (never mind that it's not too late until it arrives and is unpacked)  
I find that gets me over the hump and I can be comfortable with my purchase after that.  


Part of my set of tools for psyching myself up on big non-essential purchases is to ask myself how long it's going to be used for.  


A high-performance gaming PC has an operational lifespan between four and eight years depending on how you treat it, how intensive the games you play are, and the vagaries of random chance.

Firstly it‚Äôs suspect that you mention going outdoors or CO2 meters as alternatives. Fresh air and being outdoors won‚Äôt help you not get covid, not spread covid or recover from covid. And co2 meters might help you know if it‚Äôs time to go to the hospital if you have covid. Categorizing them as permanent things that help is just ridiculous.

Fact is that a booster will help you clear covid faster which means less time being infectious, during which you could pass it on to someone who might get really sick. 

That is reason enough to get a booster and a reason why it‚Äôs effectively mandated through passports. But not just because people getting really sick is bad, but because less people infectious for less time will reduce the spread, reducing the risk on overloading hospitals, which reduces the need to implement stricter countermeasures, which results in less impact on the economy.

Basically there's an optimum timing for responding without appearing guilty but if you can't hear well you are likely to miss that window. And if you're guessing what you missed and your response doesn't sound quite right, it can come across as being deliberately obtuse, etc,  even if everyone present is well aware that you don't hear well. The mechanics and rules of conversation are so ingrained in us that we struggle to overlook them even when we acknowledge there's a perfectly good reason for it to not go smoothly.

dehydratedrain,"Hate to say it because I've been there, but YTA. She has an incredibly stressful job, and at the end of the day it relieves a lot of stress to have someone to vent to. 



And what makes if even harder is that she is in a position where many people depend on her, so walking away will cause massive guilt to anyone that doesn't have a rock for a heart. (I say this assuming she makes arrangements to transport patients to/ from scheduled appointments, but if it's emergency transport, even more so). By banning her from work chat, she becomes even more stressed from keeping it inside or she may even look for other people to talk to and view you as mean or controlling. 


Now look at it from her perspective. Vacation days may just mean a day to relax, so coming in is just an excuse to finish the work she left behind. She is not wrong in believing that being productive is better than staying in bed (for most people, not her). So encourage her to do stuff on one of her days off. A pedicure. A movie. A good coffee out of the house. Something that gets her away from laying in bed being okay with a call to come in. 


Then be more proactive in asking her how her day was and giving her a few minutes to share what happens. Also encourage her to write it down in a journal or text, so she can recognize patterns of her boss abusing her ability to come in. And then listen to her even if you don't focus on every word.

kriskringle19,"Copy pasta from one of my previous comments on a similar question ... 

I have a two part solution that has been miraculous for me. I have historically always been a night owl, and worked 2nd shift for a number of years. Then I got a job that required me to wake up at 4am every day, 6 days a week. I almost got fired in the first month because it was IMPOSSIBLE for me to wake up. I actually got to the point where I had 25 alarms set on my phone, and had another alarm clock across the bedroom, AND A THIRD ALARM IN ANOTHER ROOM. Still slept through them all. What the hell fixed it? 

I got a large therapy light (daylight brand) and hooked it up to an automatic digital timer, and scheduled it to pop on every day at 4am. I pointed that sucker straight down at my face and put the light on the high intensity setting, so when it turns on it was like being blasted in the face by sunshine. There is also a low intensity mode that is more gentle. 

I also picked up a new coffee maker with an auto brew , and set it so it's hot and ready at 4:15. This helped on a subconscious level, because even in a sleepy state I can still smell the coffee brewing. It's a little mental nudge saying ""you better get up soon for dat fresh brew."" Also if I keep sleeping, the coffee will burn and end up cold and disgusting so that's another subconscious boost. 

These two things combined saved my job, and turned me into a ""morning person."" I don't really think I'll ever wake up at 4 am refreshed and ready to tackle the day, but I went from never waking up before 11 am to waking up at 4 every day for almost three years !",1643286287,hufi460,1,GetOutOfBed,2022-01-27T12:24:47Z

If it‚Äôs bright red (aka fresh blood), chances are you scraped the back of your throat with your nail.

Metruis,"Vices like these make you feel good, and then eventually you only feel good when you use them. You can try them if you want but also, you don't have to in order to be interesting. You just need friends who have a shared hobby, like a book or movie group, or a tabletop roleplaying game, instead of getting high or drunk together.

One of my siblings doesn't imbibe in any way either. We offer, they just don't want it, and that's cool. I smoked one cigarette with my brother once, I see the appeal but I knew if I ever did it again I wouldn't stop, so I didn't ever do it again. I occasionally have a drink. I use weed every day (not smoked). I really didn't think it would get to this point when I first tried it. It certainly hasn't ruined my life or health, but it is an expense.

It's fine to dabble if you feel like having an occasional drink, keep it to a couple per week and ideally wine and it will even benefit your health (only wine though). Keep it to a couple of mixed drinks or beers and it will be like having a pop every so often... not good for you, more calories than you're really accounting for. Drinking is easier to keep to light use because of how drunkenness disables and can even kill, but some people fall prey to it regardless of how it can be immediately dangerous when overdosed, both to your senses and to your body. With that in mind, it really isn't worth it to start unless you feel like developing a taste for wine or champagne for social events where it gets poured around for toasting, or being able to share a bit of beer or sangria from a shared pitcher. I aim to drink no more than 2 drinks per day, and preferably per week, keeping myself sober at all times but enjoying the taste of an occasional beer or wine.

If you decide you want to experience a drink, I recommend having a single glass of sangria. It is wine and fruit juice and will be as bad for you as pop, so y'know, moderation.

Let me state again, for the record, that drinking can kill you, by liver damage or by the way it makes you behave very foolishly. It's tasty, but not drinking it will make you safer, and mean you're always able to help your friends too.

Smoking you shouldn't dabble in, it's very hard to stop and very destructive to your lungs. Just don't. Your death will be awful. If you've ever seen someone dying of long term smoking... just no.

Drugs are a mixed bag. Some are REALLY bad for you and really hard to stop. Some have close to no negative side effects, and aren't even addictive. About the safest drug there is, is mushrooms. The worst that can happen is a ""bad trip"". Weed's pretty safe, but long term smoking isn't good for your lungs and most people smoke it, and it can be insidious. Even as a daily user I could stop at any time and have no effects, I did it over Christmas for some of my vacation since I wasn't in places where I felt comfortable being out of my head. At worst it was like being moody, having no coffee is actually more mentally challenging. On the the far side of the spectrum are extracted kinds of substances, like crack and meth, which are made to be extremely potent and highly addictive and, because they're manufactured, can be cut with all kinds of unknown similar or useless substances.

I would advise you stay away from any drug that doesn't look like a plant if you decide you want to experience it. A single mushroom cap or a couple of hits of marijuana is a starting dose, don't let any regular users pressure you into having too much if you choose to try it.

I was pretty anti-drug until my mid-twenties when I decided to try weed, so you may find your resolve wavers and it's important to make sure if you do choose to experience drugs, you do so at a small dose and work your way up, or the experience can be unpleasant.

Still, as weird as it may feel to be sober when all your friends are doing it, it's a good decision that will keep you safer and healthier. It's okay to enjoy a bit of the pleasures of life, but all of these pleasures have the potential to kill you if over indulged. You'd only be a fool if you blindly followed them into all experiences without consideration to your own wants and needs.",1643286232,hufi0uz,1,Advice,2022-01-27T12:23:52Z

We'd do this every day for like a month and it really helped him be less interested. I used to despair as he wanted to be in everything's business! So he needed teaching how to interact with the world. 

For signalling toilet, when she signals as she does now, ask for something else - a touch, a paw (don't do paw actually, nails hurt, maybe touch) and then say yes, take out on leash, give the toilet command, then reward. It's slow going but you can change the cue. Our dog has no cue unless he's desperate. He'll boop your leg, sit in front of you and STARE AT YOU. We taught him eye contact when he was young and now he gives serial killer staring vibes. 

For the blues, remember, you're setting them up now for a lifetime of great dog. So get those basics in, help shape them, and they'll reward you with a lifetime of good dog.

Shyguy_shiegella,"I did 9 cycles of FOLFOXIRI, that finished in November of 2021. Had stage 3 rectal cancer myself. Sorry for the long post and I don‚Äôt mean to alarm you or your husband, just want to let you both know what I experienced on that chemo regimen. 

5FU-isn‚Äôt bad, I was sent home with a little pump that would deliver the chemo over 48 hrs. I was given a little Fanny pack that kept the pump in it. Would go back to the infusion center and get unhooked. Best thing was going home and showering. One thing my oncologist told me is that it can cause chest pain in rare instances (due to it making the blood vessels of the heart to spasm) and told me to go to the ER if I ever experienced this. Fortunately never had this happen to me. 
Oxaliplatin-this one is know for causing neuropathy and cold sensitivity. For your husband do not have anything cold after chemo just because for me I had iced coffee and it felt like pure ice in my mouth going down my throat. As for the neuropathy he may or may not feel something right away I recommend a scarf and nice socks. I finished my chemo in November and the neuropathy wasn‚Äôt too bad, but now it‚Äôs back a little bit mostly in my feet and it just feels like I‚Äôm walking on sand all the time (live in NY nowhere near a beach). If you want try joining Colontown and the live wire group has a very good icing protocol of your interested in trying icing while doing chemo. 
Irinotecan-this chemo for me was the one I liked the least. This drug can cause pretty bad diarrhea, so they may give your husband atropine (a drug to help prevent it) with other drugs before chemo to help decrease nausea. Another thing I felt shortly after the Irinotecan infusion was getting flushed, hot and sweaty. I read online it‚Äôs due to it causing a release of certain chemical on your body. This feeling went away after about 24 hrs, so I didn‚Äôt think much of it. 

Other concerns nausea, fatigue and hair loss. 
-Nausea wise I was on anti nausea medication (Zofran) as needed every 6 hrs whenever I needed it, really only used it the first 3 days following chemo. Make sure you talk with the oncologist and infusion team though if the medications aren‚Äôt enough they can try other medications to help keep the nausea under control. Big thing is to stay on top of the anti nausea meds, take them before he feels nauseous. Only saying this because if he takes them when he feels nauseous it might be trying to keep up and chase trying to get the feeling away. I also drank a lot of ginger tea, room temperature ginger ale/seltzer water in between medication use. 
I also felt like staying hydrated also helped. Having water with liquid IV or any other electrolyte powder may help especially if your husband doesn‚Äôt have much of An appetite. One last thing in regards to nausea try to avoid your husband‚Äôs favorite foods when getting chemo only because he might associate those foods with chemo and that could lead to nausea (personally didn‚Äôt happen, but read about it online). 
-Fatigue wise just tell your husband to rest when he needs to/can (not sure if he‚Äôs going to continue to work). Chemo in the beginning can be a lot and the effects can be cumulative. For me around my third infusion I was very tired and the nausea was also really bad and was in bed for maybe 5 days after that infusion. Eventually I did bounce back by the midden of the following week (my off week from chemo). -Finally, hair loss not sure if you or your husband are concerned about this. I‚Äôll be honest never fully lost my hair but noticed some thinning in my head and beard. After the chemo the hair is coming back. 

Hope this helps, wishing your husband a speedy recovery! If you have any other questions feel free to PM me.",1643285619,hufh0vg,1,coloncancer,2022-01-27T12:13:39Z

* The more active I am (exercise, steps, stairs, physical activity), the more calories I tend to need. Both overeating and undereating negatively affect my physical and mental recovery.
* The more total stress there is in my life (exercise, work, family or other relationship issues, vacations/vacation planning, traveling, even video games, anything that uses mental energy or puts me in an excited/sympathetic state), the more sleep I need.

Slowly I'm forgetting what I ever saw in him. It's only been a week. Eventually I won't remember at all, because it was never real anyway, and he wasn't a normal, genuine person. I do, already, have pity for him. He'll never know what he's missing out on in life, because he can't feel anything but excitement/adrenaline or bad feelings.

May sound implausible, but setting: coffee shop in small town America, most people know each other, so not really that out of the ordinary. 

There‚Äôs a nice indie cafe a few blocks from my house, which I (28M) go to a couple of times weekly, servers all know me. This month, I had my mum with me, her visiting the US for the first time. Mum spent all her life in a SE Asian country, her English is not good, etc. Anyway, I go to work one day last week, mum wanders over to the cafe. 

I get home that night, ask mum how her trip to the cafe was. She says its nice, told me what she got, and fuck - I forget she doesn‚Äôt know about tipping here (where she lives, there‚Äôs a large service charge included so you don‚Äôt really tip in eateries, and def not in small ones). COMPLETELY my bad, and entirely my fault for forgetting to inform her. I ask her which server, she describes someone I know as Jane (25ish F). 

I go to the cafe the next day the minute it opens, sees Jane is working, and apologise profusely, explains my mum doesn‚Äôt know re tipping, and give her a 70% tip (bill came up to around $10 so it wasn‚Äôt really breaking the bank). She‚Äôs understandably slightly cool, but I apologise to the best of my ability. 

I thought that was that. No, 2 days later a colleague texts me a link to a TikTok. Jane apparently has a sizeable TikTok following where she talks about being a barista, her customers, how to make x or y drink. Nice stuff. Except a video from the day my mum visited, where Jane videoed the back and side of her head, made jokes about people coming over from ‚Äúfuck knows‚Äù not tipping because its ‚Äúman eat dog world out there‚Äù, quietly barked on video (she didn‚Äôt seem to notice it was at her). LOTS of shares and likes and comments, btw. Again, our town is 99% white, Jane wouldn‚Äôt really be encountering many foreigners at all, it‚Äôs not a no-tip epidemic.

Gave her benefit of the doubt, went over the next day and politely asked her to take it down. She said no, it‚Äôs her right, and it was her ‚Äúdegrading‚Äù experience. Manager comes over, Jane tells the tipping part and that she made a video ‚Äúout of desperation‚Äù and she wouldn‚Äôt take it down. I tell manager that I came back, apologised, tipped her 70%, and explained my mum didn‚Äôt know. I showed her the Tiktok, and manager‚Äôs face changes. She doesn‚Äôt discipline Jane in front of me, but from what I hear, she was let go immediately.

Now her mother is posting on her own and my FB, as well as hinting on the community FB group about certain peoole not respecting servers, and causing Jane to be fired. Several people (many who don‚Äôt know the whole story) agreeing with her, even discussing setting up a collection. Almost total belief that I am the AH, no mention of the TikTok. 

AITA? Should I have dragged my 70 y/o mum in to apologise to Jane? What exactly can I do now?

jams1015,"We used to have a Share a Cup (Moment?) or some button. I don't remember what it was called. They took it away a couple years ago and replaced it with Right Now Recovery. It presupposes we done fucked something up and have to Band Aid it with a free frap. 

We also have little recovery cards we can scan and pass out when issues arise. 

The Right Now Recovery button can cover the cost of any drink, all mods included. 

The recovery card is $4.00 flat, no way to increase the amount loaded. 

I give polite angry/disappointed crusties Right Now Recoveries and immediately make things better for them, whereas assholes get recovery cards to use $4 toward their next purchase, lol, which will cover maybe half their mods.

Redditshausmeier,"&gt; But 1 thousand Marines? A Starship for 1,000 tall dudes?

Its not the 1,0000 marines who are the reason for the ships size.

&gt; The biggest ship we have on Earth today is the Gerald Ford Aircraft Carrier. Its 333 meters long, and it carries 4500 people, not to mention the countless facilities needed to accommodate them (med bays, armories, cantinas, etc.)

But thats basically the point. A Dauntless class light cruiser has a crew of 65,000 humans/servitors. (according to the wiki). The ship has engines, weapons, fighter bays, sensor arrays, etc. And aircraft carrier is - i relation to a 40k ship - a simple construction **which is also more automated**. A modern aircraft carrier doesnt need 2,000 guys i red robes rubbing holy oils on each toilette to make them flush reliable. The US navy also does not require prayings infront of each coffee machine twice a day. Also a Phalanx CIWS on a Gerald Ford Aircraft Carrier needs one operator. You can safely assume something equivalent of a Phalanx in 40k needs 25 people to be operated. Larger guns hundreds of people. The main lance weapons thousands of people. (I guess they shove the photons in by hand or so ...)

The smallest warp-capable ships used by Space Marines on a regular basis are the Deathwatches Dark Hunters. And those things are really small by 40k standards. 1,200 meters long with a crew of 10,000 humans/servitors.",1643284940,huffyt8,1,40kLore,2022-01-27T12:02:20Z

midrandom,"It's not that I've only had a single non-dual experience over all these years, but that was the only spontaneous, hours-long, effortless experience. I've had some good, insightful, non-dual experiences during dedicated practice, and the occasional spontaneous moments during other activities, but never anything like that day. That day was effortless and sustained for hours, in the midst of morning traffic, walking through the parking lot, opening the building door, climbing many  flights of stairs, walking down the hall, unlocking the door, turning on the coffee maker, turing on the office lights, waking up my computer, checking the morning email, etc. Once the basic morning routines were done, I went and sat on a sofa in the lounge for a few hours, just sitting, absorbing each moment. Being each moment. One way I tried to express it was, ""I am this moment"", and realizing that the, ""I am,"" part is utterly redundant. Just this moment. And this moment. And this moment... . Eventually, I had the urge to try to write it down, and in the act of trying to describe it, it began to fade.

So it's not that decades of practice haven't been good for me, nor provided any insight, indeed they have many times, as well as shifted many of my overall attitudes,  but that day was very special. It gave me an understanding of how ""natural"" it can be, how stable and effortless. That is something I have not experienced again. 

So ghost of that experience is always available, if I turn attention to it, there it is, and the self becomes ghost-like. It feels right and in some ways obvious, but with all the clutter of duality and ego overlaying and obscuring it.

So the motivation is pretty easy. That experience hovers underneath everything if looked for, but its still so easy to forget, getting lost in the useful tool of self. The task now it to pull those two ways of experiencing into harmony, not two, but also not one. I have a vague sense of what that might be like, but no clear idea of how to get there from here, other than to continue practice, while trying not to try. It's difficult not to try. I hope that makes sense. :)",1643284875,huffvb2,1,Wakingupapp,2022-01-27T12:01:15Z

ASarcasticEngineer,"""A wretched hive of scum and villainy""


My parents moved near to Skeg Vegas. It's not as bad as I thought. Everything is an Irish pub, there's always a betting or gambling place withing eyesight. Cheap knock-off shops galore. Other than that there's not that much to get excited about.


My first foray if Skeggy had me witness two grown men screaming at each other before one stomps off yelling he's going to get his knife so he can stab the other.

I remember with absolutely clarity the slack jawed expression of the surrounding crowds while they watched the entertainment for the day before continuing like nothing had happened.

The guy under threat of stabbing just stuck his hand down his joggers to play with his balls. Though given how deep he had to dig he may well have been picking his bum. Sniffed his finger and proceeded to have a conversation with what I assume was his girlfriend. She was completely non plussed with the goings on.

At this point my mother declares that there's a nice churro stand near the sea front and marches off to get churros.

We get to the infamous churro stand, on a very cold day, ask for and pay for our churros. The guy struggles away trying to pump the batter out into the fryer but has absolutely no luck. He gets a coffee stirring stick and starts poking it up the nozzle but still nothing. Then he takes the canister of batter out of the machine and starts punching the batter down before reloading it and trying with just as little success. He repeats this process several times and eventually something starts spurting out.

He serves us what I can only describe as ""not a churro"". In true British fashion we accept the offering, thank him and walk away.

The not churros were misshapen, salty and chewy. My mum comments that they're usually nicer before deciding they're inedible and marching back to demand a refund.

Then we went home.

It was a real roller coaster of a day.

NoneOfOurConcern,"‚ÄúYou know, miss piggy was telling me the other day how she was so happy she never went on the birth control pill. Oooohh yeah you best believe it. She said, and this was so funny to me thinking about it from the Jungian perspective that we are shaped by our aspirations in tandem with our past experiences and how she also falls into several archetypes that you could grace back to Cain and Abel and how one was searching for greater meaning whilst one was content with the purpose given and I don‚Äôt have to tell you which is which oh no haha but I digress. She said to me she was so happy she never took the birth control pill because being a mother was such an important aspect of her being. Her role in life. In the collective unconscious she is born to breed the piglets for the slaughter like her mothers before her. 
And some on the left may argue that‚Äôs contrarian or reductive or vile but it‚Äôs an important aspect of society that the bacon gets served, you know? It‚Äôs important to how things have been and have worked. I mean, think of all these vegan men out there not getting their coffee and their bacon and eggs in the morning! It‚Äôs crazy to think how they must be struggling so hard to repress that important desire. Now there‚Äôs power in that I‚Äôll give it to them but power used to obtain weakness is, oh boy, don‚Äôt get me started on that contradiction but I think that alone will tell you everything you need to know about the desires of the cultural Marxist and how the post modernists think. 
But yes miss piggy, so happy she never went on it. I said it‚Äôs like being taken off the leash. In the moment the dog feels free and good but then BAM! Dogs run over on the road.

I posted on another subreddit at the beginning of the pandemic of where I could go to study and most people recommended coffee shops. The working opposite of your family's schedule seems like a good idea too, but it might be difficult to fit into your schedule or might disrupt your sleep schedule.

Honestly, the best place I can think of is the fast food place, as long as they're open and allow dining in, or any cheap restaurant/place to be. Unfortunately, you'll have to spend some money to stay there, but it's the best idea I can think of. I'm sorry that I can't be of more help.

Perhaps talking with your family could be useful too. Explain to them that you're struggling to find the time/place/focus to study and your license could be on the line. You have applied to be allowed on campus, bit they're being fidgety because of the pa demic. Perhaps your sibling(s) (the parents of nieces/nephews) could work out a schedule with you. It may require a little bit of compromise, like asking if you watch them Saturday night (they'll hopefully be sleeping after a certain time, which could hopefully give you either study time, sleep time, or relaxation time), if they agree to take the kids to the park on Sunday to let the house be a little quiet for you.

ApolloHouse,"I‚Äôve lived in Lewes for about 4 years now. Early 30s. Depends what you‚Äôre looking for. It‚Äôs surrounded by beautiful countryside. Has a bunch of good independent shops and cafes (Needlemakers). Has two new breweries with taprooms (Beak and Abyss) which have live music, great beer and good food. A couple of nice coffee roasters (Tigermoth and Pharmacie). 

The Depot (cinema) is great and plenty of good food options. As mentioned by others, lots of good pubs. 

You‚Äôre well connected for Brighton (it‚Äôs always a smashing walk) and to London. 

Housing is expensive and old in the centre. Nice to look at and walk around but expensive to buy. 

If you‚Äôre sporty, there is a good sports club (Southdown) that has hockey, tennis, squash, 5-a-side football. Plenty of people your age. 

In short, lots going for it. My experience is that it‚Äôs got a nice community feel, good for young families, and it‚Äôs surrounded by amazing countryside. 

If you‚Äôre looking for higher octane stuff - move to Brighton. Either way, I think both are a great option. It‚Äôs a nice part of the world and you‚Äôll find something for you.",1643284336,huff23z,1,brighton,2022-01-27T11:52:16Z

bigislandcowboy,"Tough challenge. But things will work out fine!

Sounds like you may be like many women - a little socially awkward. I don‚Äôt know another way to start turning that around other than pushing yourself a bit to interact with new women and with new men in person. One-on-one interactions, as well as group interactions, if you are still needing to get more comfortable with both. 

As they say, ‚ÄúLife happens *out there‚Äù*. It happens in the context of relationships with other humans - not solitary and from behind cell phone and computer screens. No better time than now to grow your comfort with that. 

For the situation you posted about - consider agreeing to grabbing a bite. 

I know everyone has preferences for different things they like or would rather avoid during date experiences‚Ä¶ It seems difficult, though, to imagine modern dating being done in a way that sidesteps food altogether. 

So maybe with the current guy, you say, ‚ÄúGreat - I‚Äôd be up for that. Even if I end up wanting a giant cup of coffee instead of a meal ‚òïÔ∏è üíú.‚Äù (Or replace that with tea or whatever if you hate coffee)

That way you can practice with sitting in a restaurant with a new dating partner; you order a beverage instead of a meal - which addresses your eating pattern concern. 

The other thing would be, of course, to continue trying to resolve the eating pattern issue. Or at least figure out a good solution to keep it from blocking all the many romantic, platonic, and business situations that will come up involving people getting together over a meal. 

Oh yeah, you mentioned ‚Äúscariness‚Äù of going on a date with someone unfamiliar. If that means you are coming from a place of feeling actual safety concerns, simply take steps to reduce risk and increase safety. Have a friend be also hanging out at the same restaurant at the same time - though DEF not interacting with you during your date or interrupting the date (it would be appropriate for your dating partner to have your full attention without you or your girlfriend choosing to be in and out of hanging with each other during a scheduled date that the gentleman invited you for and is hosting you for).

goodreads-bot,"[**Stick a Flag in It: 1,000 Years of Bizarre History from Britain and Beyond**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54162921-stick-a-flag-in-it)

^(By: Arran Lomas | 442 pages | Published: 2020 | Popular Shelves: history, non-fiction, netgalley, kindle, nonfiction)

&gt;From the Norman Invasion in 1066 to the eve of the First World War, Stick a Flag in It is a thousand-year jocular journey through the history of Britain and its global empire.
&gt;
&gt;The British people have always been eccentric, occasionally ingenious and, sure, sometimes unhinged ‚Äì from mad monarchs to mass-murdering lepers. Here, Arran Lomas shows us how they harnessed those traits to forge the British nation, and indeed the world, we know today.
&gt;
&gt;Follow history‚Äôs greatest adventurers from the swashbuckling waters of the Caribbean to the vast white wasteland of the Antarctic wilderness, like the British spy who infiltrated a top-secret Indian brothel and the priest who hid inside a wall but forgot to bring a packed lunch. At the very least you‚Äôll discover Henry VIII‚Äôs favourite arse-wipe, whether the flying alchemist ever made it from Scotland to France, and the connection between Victorian coffee houses and dildos.
&gt;
&gt;Forget what you were taught in school ‚Äì this is history like you‚Äôve never heard it before, full of captivating historical quirks that will make you laugh out loud and scratch your head in disbelief.

TheBigBadBear20,"There was a kid in my design tech class at GCSE age. He was actually really good at electronics and stuff, coding, wiring, all of it, but he also claimed that he was......


A-the most intelligent person ever, which was disputed by his poor test results in his other subjects. I had a friend who he  explained stuff to really patronisingly, only to be outscored by my friend by a massive margin.

B-a lecturer at both oxford and harvard universities. This explained why he was always drinking coffee- he was up all night travelling to and from these universities to give lectures at around 1am-4am every day. He even had his security badge for both unis on a lanyard, which, in actual fact, was a dog-eared piece of paper printed out in crappy quality, and glued into the lanyard card holder. ""He was getting a real one soon.""

C-a government agent who knew highly sensitive secrets which, if they got out, could cause the collapse of the western world as we know it.

D-was building a nuclear powered supercomputer with the bits of scrap he collected from the electronics store cupboard (pathetic resistors, LEDs, wiring, etc. The most powerful thing in that cupboard was an arduino uno). He carried the blueprints everywhere he went, but nobody was allowed to see them. (It was a roll of white paper sat in a cardboard box with miscellaneous wires and blinky lights.

What happened to him? He stole mixing desks (a good 2x3 feet in size) from the music department....twice. i guess for his supercomputer? The first time he got two weeks suspension, but when it happened again, i think the teachers were scared this supercomputer could end the world, and didnt want to be traced back as this guy's parts supplier.",1643284099,hufep10,1,AskReddit,2022-01-27T11:48:19Z

Jetblacksteel,"I thought it was just a bright day time window but it's just a really bright kitchen light. Which will not be read right with lower quality cameras. You can see the shadow move from where the cat is to the fridge, in a line almost. And the fact OP stated that the shadow was there for a few seconds before fading out is also strange. A bug is probably the only reasonable thing I can think of. Taking into account the shadow that moves, and the counters shadow it seems as though it doesn't overlap it at all. Thus meaning whatever is causing the shadow has to be between the counter and the light. The hard shadow right in front of the fridge is caused by what seems to be a coffee maker from the day time photo. It's most likely a bug on the coffee maker walking across the surface. It's displacing the intense light which on the floor looks huge. Considering the coffee maker is not as big as its shadow would lead you to believe. Worst case scenario a small rodent but probably not.

If you were to test this I would suggest placing very small objects on top of that coffee maker and seeing how it looks on the floor shadows. How does it compare to the footage? How does it show up on the lower quality camera? If it's not the coffee maker then is something else in front of the light? What's making the big shadow right in front of it? Is the actual cabinet causing it? And just go from there. It took a few replays to catch that the shadow doesn't overlap the shadows already on the floor. So it has to be something on the counter.",1643284050,hufemfx,1,Ghosts,2022-01-27T11:47:30Z

Forsaken-Hedgehog75,"As someone who lives in France (but isn't French), I've found the answers to the question very enlightening!  So many different opinions.

For my part, I've early retired to a rural and isolated part of France. Life is quiet and slow paced. The perfect place to be right now in many respects (lockdowns were effectively no different to how I lived anyway!)

I love it. The area is beautiful and calm. I can ride my bike miles without seeing much in the way of traffic - just the birds, cows and horses! Stop off at a cafe for a coffee and a pastry. People are so relaxed and friendly (sometimes abrupt but that's just their manner)

There are downsides, yes, particularly in the winter when the wet and cold can make you feel very isolated. Rural life in France (like in many countries I suspect) is being hit by underfunding of services - or non-existent services sometimes. Some towns don't have a doctor for instance. Some areas don't have public transport. You have to have a car (is it any wonder the 'gilet jaune' movement sprang up?) and petrol costs are even higher now. Some people spending ‚Ç¨250 - ‚Ç¨300 per month on petrol, which is a high percentage of what they earn. What choice do they have but to pay it?

And, yes, France can be overly bureaucratic sometimes - but it is also wonderfully 'joined up' behind-the-scenes sometimes too. I don't have to apply for electricity rebates, or tax reductions, or pay extra for health care - everything just happens because I am a part of the system.

I'm sure I wouldn't be quite so in love with France if I lived in Paris, or Marseilles, or any other big city, but I love it where I am and I'm SO pleased I moved here. I'm here for the rest of my life, enjoying the summers from my back garden!",1643284012,hufekd7,1,AskFrance,2022-01-27T11:46:52Z

Dragnskull,"&gt;You must be unaware that in the 80s and 90s Coca Cola released hundreds of collectible items that are currently worth so little it doesn't even make sense to resell them because the shipping would eat all the revenue.

I'm very aware, I just wasn't using those for examples. You're correct to an extent as many items such as this are cheap and hold little to no value. ('m referring to buttons, pins, magnets, etc.) Also the argument isn't ""are they profitable yet"", the argument is ""do they increase in price?"" which I believe they are, just extremely slowly.

That said:

\-We're talking about MTG, I would argue there's a significant difference between a product with collector value being an additional / secondary interest factor (with them being a game to play as the primary) so it's not really a fair comparison

\-These items are by design supposed to be extremely cheap. the very point of these types of items is to hand out thousands/millions of things with the coca cola logo to create massive brand recognition and loyalty. 

\-Even with the above facts, go do a search for ""coca cola"" (and set US only for location) and you'll see the cheapest item currently is a sticker for 1.40 + 0.60 shipping, which is 2x the minimum allowed ebay price of 99 cents + free shipping

\-A significant amount of these types of items are straight up designed to be given out for free ie they begin with, this means if anyone pays even a penny for one, its value has increased.

\-Do ebay searches for ""coca cola XX"" and/or ""coca cola XXXX"" with X being random years. You'll notice every step back to the previous generation (generally) results in an increase of cheapest-item cost. This is proof that even your example of cheap garbage designed to be cheap and worthless is gaining value.

as for the 5 dollar coffee mug type items go- I challenge you to find a single example of an item being the same price or cheaper than it's original retail price, even after adjusting for inflation. You're likely only going to find paper products that accomplish this (post cards for example)",1643283823,hufea6d,1,mtgfinance,2022-01-27T11:43:43Z

Ahole_Judge,"At work there was a nice guy from a different department who I used to see in the communal kitchen area. We'd make some coffee and chat about politics and life and whathaveyou. He was super chill.

Then one day I said something very casually that he seemed not to like and, instead of being calm and direct about it, he just flipped out and started throwing around cursewords and making an idiot of himself. I told him I was sorry to see that he was upset and asked him what exactly I had said to offend him and he carried on tantruming, refused to tell me and kept saying that the entire fact I do not know shows what a privileged white male I am blah blah blah, that I've never worked a day in my life (yeah, this was at work). I was shocked but ended up having to walk away from him.

He later came to my desk to apologize. I told him I appreciate his apology but am honestly still confused as to what exactly I said to cause him to react like that, as he wouldn't tell me and that I'd appreciate knowing. He then flipped out again and just started being unprofessional, in the middle of my office space.

Then, using milk splitting you can pour the milk 2 cups at a time.
In &lt;5mins you‚Äôll have 4-6 cappuccino. Use cups around 150ml and milk/coffee ratio is quite ok, you can always make another round.

Admittedly, I had my suspicions that he might have been a bit of an exaggerator because anytime he told a story, it sort of made you go ‚Äúwait really?‚Äù. Well, the day that I discovered he was a chronic liar was when he had left an msn chat open (yes that long ago lol) and he wrote the most obscene crazy lie ever. I should note, I wasn‚Äôt snooping on purpose, his laptop was open in the living room on the coffee table and I went to sit on the couch and the chat log like right there, hard to miss.. Anyway, he was telling this dude he was in a completely different province, that he was in Canada for some bike competition (can‚Äôt remember if it was bmx or those downhill mountain things) and that he had already gotten a medal the other day for whatever and it went on. I think he even went as far as to pull a photo off Google or something to tell this person where he was, like that he had taken the photo. He also got a well known city in the wrong province, I think he said Whistler, Alberta or something? What‚Äôs important here, he did bike stuff like mountain trails and stuff in skate parks but the guy never competed in his life and was pretty mediocre. But that was the beginning and since then I would realize, catch on or notice the little things that he‚Äôd say were not true. I got out of that relationship pretty fast after that and it has given me some trust issues not only with men but with people for a long time after that.

- SNS affects men and women
- The mechanism may involve endorphins, dopamine, and hormones
-  It may be the same mechanism as D-MERS, but with ppl who are not lactating
- Direct research is currently non-existent
- Cognitive behavioral therapy can help
- connecting to others via online support communities can help
- Learning it's safe can help

2. [Sadnipplesyndrome.com](https://sadnipplesyndrome.com/learnmore/)

- Suggests SNS may be distinct from D-MERS
- Proposes two theories:

Theory 1. SNS could be a hormonal response, similar to D-MERS
Theory 2. SNS could be a mental response, perhaps related to trauma

- Features an [artist's exploration](https://sadnipplesyndrome.com/enjoy-the-sns-crazy-world/) of their SNS symptoms

3. A page on [Non-classical Sofrimento](https://lgbta.fandom.com/wiki/NCST_Sofrimento)

- Sofrimento is a kind of gender dysphoria where ppl feel dysphoric towards one or more sexual traits
- may include nipples
- doesn't mention symptoms caused by nipple stimulation

Note: This doesn't sound much like the experience you describe. But it provides be a potentially helpful third theory to explore and either confirm or reject:

Theory 3. SNS symptoms could be related to gender dysphoria

Results:

1. A 2011 [case study](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/1746-4358-6-6.pdf) of D-MERS

- Has good background on D-MERS
- has a high quality case report, including symptoms that similar to yours
- it mentions homesickness
- it mentions sad nipple syndrome
- it classifies the symptoms into anxiety, depression, and anger. This may be useful for describing and understanding your symptoms
- discusses a dopamine theory for the symptoms, suggesting:

Theory 4. SNS like symptoms could be mainly a dopamine response, triggered by signals from nipple stimulation

- finally, it lists factors that can help or worsen symptoms:

Things that may help:

- Connecting to other suffers
- online communities
- learning the condition is safe
- Rhodiola may help
- pseudoephedrine may help

Things that may worsen symptoms:

- coffee may worsen symptoms
- stress may make things worse
- meals with extended family may make things worse ü•∫


###### III. Summary

Your symptoms sound most like SNS, but ideas from nipple dysphoria and D-MERS may help test hypotheses and find treatment and coping strategies. The medical research is sparse at this point. Learning about the condition, sharing your story, and connecting with other ppl can help lighten the load, which can reduce the symptoms. Counseling can help, and so might certain medicines and supplements.",1643283114,hufd8uz,1,TwoXChromosomes,2022-01-27T11:31:54Z

mezzaninedoor,I had some years when I struggled at work but generally I was fairly high functioning with my Bi-Polar though manic phases could be difficult for those around me.  Generally I could tell when I was depressive or anxious but not when I was manic.  I was very open in the workplace once I had a diagnosis and had friends who acted as spotters and would take me for a coffee and chat when I was flying along manically full of good and great ideas and too many of them.   The spotters were essential otherwise I pissed off too many people.  Low periods were different and would often see me off work rolled up in blankets in bed but I managed it as best I can.  I never lost a job but I did lose roles on some high profile work as not all my managers understood though the good ones did.   I think by working with me The company did better out of me when engaged with me.  Eventually things became a bit frenetic and though I‚Äôd got into a senior position as a leader and manager myself I had to ask myself for a demotion to take the pressure off.  It was good to take a role and pay cut.  I‚Äôm now retired and with my meds settled and reviewed things are good.

peppyinmysteppy,"Oooh I didn‚Äôt expect a big comment!

I don‚Äôt get compliments on my eyes too much, unless I wear eyeliner so girls compliment the makeup. :) Closed mouth smile because my thin lips disappear when it‚Äôs all teeth, so I think I look a little better with it that way lol. I grew up super super shy. To the point in school if I had to read aloud my classmates would be like ‚Äúshe talks?‚Äù or to ask me to speak up. I still don‚Äôt really approach anyone or make calls often, but I try to every once in a while. I‚Äôm private about certain things, mostly just stuff that concerns other people on my life. Me personally I‚Äôm very open about talking about things, if I‚Äôm asked about it.

I do trim my eyebrows haha. Myself. But they‚Äôre thin so makeup helps to make them look a little thicker. I LOVE PINK. I actually dislike hot pink most of the time though, but a friend bought me the jacket for Christmas so I like it because of that even if it‚Äôs a bad pink. Idk if I‚Äôm proud to be a woman? I‚Äôm happy I am. I‚Äôd rather be a woman and shaped this way instead of like a guy. I don‚Äôt like the bleeding part though! That sucks.

Not very conservative. I don‚Äôt go to church even though I do live in the Bible Belt of Alabama. My mom prays at every dinner though, and most of her fb posts consist of mentioning Jesus and such. I have an agnostic stance I guess if I have to label it. I don‚Äôt look like it here but I dye my hair a lot of bright colors and wear grungy or bright makeup when I go out. I‚Äôll wear a pink crop top and a skirt, another day all black w platform boots and fishnet, another day I‚Äôll dress like a tomboy that likes midwestern emo music. But I‚Äôm aware of where I live so I dress more conservatively when it calls for it. No cleavage, skirt at the knee kind of stuff to be respectful.

I‚Äôm kind of health conscious in a way, but a lot of it goes into being critical of the way I looked growing up (Not very overweight but when you‚Äôre short even 10 lbs looks a lot different than if you‚Äôre taller) more than wanting to be healthy to be healthy. I drink a lot of things that are gonna RUIN my teeth if I keep it up, like soda and coffee and tea so that isn‚Äôt too healthy for me.

Job isn‚Äôt white collar. I had to look up if it counted as blue collar because I wasn‚Äôt sure. Some things on google said it‚Äôs just service industry since it‚Äôs not labor, but then also it says service and retail counts as blue collar so idk!

And I‚Äôm 25 and turning 26 in April, so I‚Äôm on the brink of late 20s.",1643282630,hufcko9,1,firstimpression,2022-01-27T11:23:50Z

_the_improving_man,"## OYS 1 - drunk captain, sobering up, cleaning up and angry with himself

44yr, 6‚Äù4, 227lbs (103kg); BF 17.4% (scales), married 13 yrs (20 together), 3 children (all under 12)

## Background
I discovered MRP 12 months ago, have drifted in and out over that time. Reading the OYS weekly and hearing your stories has been an incredibly positive experience. So what is different now to cause me to OYS #1, i think it was from reading recent ‚ÄúPut your ego in Box‚Äù post that it dawned on my that I had not committed fully to the recommended MRP process [lift, STFU, sidebar, OYS]. I was going along and avoiding the recommended work (weekly OYS, reading the sidebar/texts and internalising). It dawned on me that it was my ego again, protecting me from doing work/committing. 

With the above in my head, at the beach on the weekend with family at a kids pool, I saw all these fathers, with dad bodies, fat, overweight, no strength, starring into space or their phone, jumping to their wife‚Äôs requests or worse their wife yelling or talking stern to them and with a coffee or energy drink in their hand. I saw their defeat, and then saw my own defeat. Why do I accept mediocre results from myself? 

Why am I not fucking the way I want to fuck? Why are my financials a mess? Where is my strength, ability to fight? I drew more inspiration from the MRP group here, many of you and your journey, ‚Ä¶ then a switch flipped in my head, now it is my turn to have that journey, just commit to the process and see what happens in a year. Hence, I have now arrived at OYS #1

## Weaknesses
* Scared of confrontation - especially the scenarios I make in my head. Impacts me physically with my nervous system firing (mouth goes dry, sweaty arm pits and palms, my voice faults, DEER big time). Solution: read WISNIFG and internalise it. Scanned it in the past.
* Execution - I tend to drift away from (a) consistent effort and (b) getting things finished. My taxes, projects around the house, new biz/investments. solution: 
   * concentrate on not starting more projects until other is done. 
   * Ensure my tracking systems show me what is late, and this view persists. rather than drift off front page to be forgotten.
   * STFU with regards to my plans, actions, concerns, risks, etc.
   * Set time on my calendar each week for me to review and plan my shit. I get pulled into other urgent requests and then wife criticises me later that ‚ÄúYou still have not got XYZ done‚Äù, or ‚Äúit took you 3 months just to do ABC‚Äù. Which is 100% true, my fault for not prioritising my goals (thinking I need to be agreeable with those around me for them to love me, Beta thinking)

## Sex
My mind goes back to one evening last year, walking along beach with the wife, without children and I shared a fantasy, along lines of us emerging from the water naked, I chase here down around the rocks, we taste the salt on each other‚Äôs bodies. Afterwards we slide back into the ocean to clean off. Our skin warm from the sun. Maybe I should not have even shared this? Anyhow the response I got was a total shit storm, ‚ÄúI hate you putting unrealistic pressure on me‚Äù, ‚ÄúI would never do that‚Äù, ‚Äúyou have ruined this nice evening, you always want more‚Äù etc etc then go home in shitty silent mood. My thinking afterwards, the response could have been, ‚Äúwow, that sounds sexy‚Äù, ‚Äúwe could try one day when kids are at school‚Äù, ‚Äúmaybe at home I could wear my bikini, putting on the coconut oil you like and we could pretend we are at the beach?‚Äù.  This event still floats in and out of my thinking, why can‚Äôt I have the experiences I want? What is wrong with me? Am I bad? But I do heaps. Was she ‚Äúmaking rules for me, because I am beta?‚Äù. Would she do this for other men? If so what do I need to become? Was it unfair of me to bring it up? Am I sharing this fantasy with the wrong woman? Is it because my leadership sucks?

## Health
Twelve months ago, when I started reading MRP, I would classify myself as a drunk captain. Working long hours during week, propped up on coffee, dragging my feet into weekend, to drown myself in booze and energy drinks. No energy on weekends. Feeling like I was owed (a) a better response from family (from my working/earning) and (b) the reward of alcohol to ‚Äúrelax‚Äù. So I stopped drinking - what a fucking huge difference that made. I dropped weight and improved energy on weekend. This last 3 weeks I stopped coffee and energy drinks and now after come down, many things have improved. Teeth look cleaner, my focus stronger, sleep deeper, my nervous system calmed down (no sweaty arm pits). 

There is more, but rather than dump it all out now, I just wanted to start my OYS journey, just get it done and then iterate and join the men here sharing notes.",1643282577,hufci4p,1,marriedredpill,2022-01-27T11:22:57Z

As I was walking past the Brigham Young Monument, I saw a homeless man walk into temple square.   I just noticed him.  Then I went to grab my coffee. 

On my way back, I noticed that he was sleeping on a bench.  As I approached, I was startled by a cadre of what I can only describe as ""Men in Black"".  Sunglasses, earpieces, full suits and ties.  There were easily eight to ten of them.  They beelined for the homeless guy.  They picked him up as a group.  And they disappeared.  They were literally gone within seconds.  I truly don't even know how they got out of my sight so quickly.

I AM ABOUT TO TRY THIS. This evening. With a friend that I ghosted because I felt abandoned. The promising thing is we both reached out to each other at the same time, so maybe we can fix it...

majolie1970,"I‚Äôm 52. I have been a lot of places. There are still so many places I want to go. While not my biggest regret in life, I still regret every travel opportunity I passed up over the years. So many places where I said now‚Äôs not a convenient time, other things are more important right now, money is too tight, I can always go there some other time, etc. Many of those places I never did get there. 
Plus, from my perspective, I can‚Äôt help but think of the memories you might be passing up on. My dad just got diagnosed with cancer, and if I could go back in time and cram in even one more day together doing anything, I would. And you never know if this trip might be an experience that changes your relationship with that whole part of your family in a really positive way. I know you said you love them all, but you may still build something stronger that ends up being really important for the rest of your life. 
I do get how a baby can detract from a travel experience. I have two of my own kids and I won‚Äôt forget how much more challenging travel was when they were small. But as was already mentioned - you might be able to get away from them a bit at your age, whether going to a park or museum or shopping area, or just grabbing a coffee in a cafe or a coke while sitting by the pool. And you might be surprised to find, possibly, that your little sister happens to be going through a phase during the trip that you really enjoy. Babies change so much week to week, and there are definitely good things about spending time with a baby - you may enjoy the time getting to know her as she starts to become more of a real person.

Im_still_T,"500-1500 cal a day. I cut out nearly all carbs, soda, and sweets. I work on the 4th floor, so I use the restroom in our lobby; that coupled with smoke breaks, I go up and down 4 flights of steps 4-8 times a day. I chug as much water and coffee I possibly can all day at work, which suppresses appetite. I also take a 30 min to an hour walk around my neighborhood 3-6 days a wk. I've dropped a little over 60 lbs since July last yr. For the past month, I've been slowly increasing calorie count to get back to a more normal diet/eating schedule, and I've still lost a few more in that time. 

I take 100mg Seroquel @ bedtime and 200mg lamictal once a day. 

It's possible. Easy? Well, that depends on your drive and will power. The first month or so sucked, but after that, it became routine.

Adjusting calories in/out is a much better way to lose weight than working out on its own. You can actually eat nothing but junk food and take vitamins, not workout at all, and drop weight quickly as long as you maintain a calorie deficit less than required by your resting metabolic rate.

bitusher,"&gt;because less available coins means less money velocity, which means less usage, 

This isn't true. This is what is suggested would happen with scary terms such as ""deflationary death spiral"" but thus far Bitcoin has proven this incorrect. During period of high deflation(appreciation) ,where less coins are available to be sold, tx velocity tends to increase and merchant processors actually see an increase in spending for goods and services and charitable giving in Bitcoin.

This is believed to be caused by the feeling of newfound wealth(because they are wealthier) eventually overrides their desire to ""hoard"" (when did savings become a negative thing?) their Bitcoin.

&gt;I believe a big part of the solution is to improve UX 

One of the largest aspects of a better UX is reducing volatility where their is more liquidity (much higher market cap) where lost coins actually improve 

Keep in mind that Bitcoin is going through the normal stages of becoming a currency.

Collectible&gt;Asset/commodity&gt;volatile currency&gt;Stable unit of account currency

Right now Bitcoin is between stage 2 and 3. 

We don't want people to be losing Bitcoins left and right because that will lead to frustration from new users but thankfully very few Bitcoin are lost these days because improvements in security and wallets UX 

Since Bitcoin is extremely divisible (13 decimal places in a payment channel) the total amount doesn't matter because even if Bitcoin is worth 100 million a coin you can still have enough divisibility to buy a cup of coffee. 

**There is plenty of parts to go around** 

Divisibility is not the same thing as increased inflation either as 1 usd = 4 quarters = 10 dimes = 100 pennies with purchasing power and inflation only occurs when another dollar is printed to drive down the spending power of each dollar.",1643281725,hufbc4u,1,BitcoinBeginners,2022-01-27T11:08:45Z

I (28f) had a friend ""lily"" (28f) when i was in college. We knew each other but were not close friends, just you know if met eyes or saw each other we said 'hello' or had a small talk. We added each other on fb before we moved to our respective cities for job.

 One years ago, i saw her posting about her new bf 'kyle'. He looked familiar but i cant figure out where i had seen him. Kyle was offered a new job at my city and moved here, so does lily. Two months back, she asked me to find a place to rent for her and her bf. I found one two blocks away from me and told her. She liked it and last month they moved. Since im the only one who she knows, she invited me for coffe and some chit chat at her house. That is when i found out that his bf is from my school. Kyle was that typical serial cheater, famous, athletic guy. Now im not sure how much he changed but i had my doubts right then. But anyways, i tried not to be prejudiced against his bf.

Two weeks ago, when i went to a coffee shop, i saw his bf with a woman. He was laughing and was a bit touchy touchy with her. I clicked his picture and thought about whether i should tell lily or not. She wasnt my best friend or very close so im not sure if she will trust me but if i was at her place i definitely wanted to know. So i told her. 

Two days after that, his bf messaged me how im an asshole, how i invaded his privacy and how i ruined his relationship with lily. Last week lily called me and told me she broke up with him and she was crying because she literally displaced her whole life because of him. I went to her house and that is when kyle came to their house with the same woman and told us that she is his cousin and she was in the city for a meeting. It was awkward since kyle was just ignoring me like im not even there and  cousin was side eyeing me like i killed a puppy. Lily was confused and told us all to leave. We left. Two days ago kyle again messaged me and called me a b**** and told me how i ruined their perfect relationship. I havent talked to lily, i havent talked or apologize to kyle. Im not sure if she is really cousin. Lily had no idea he had a cousin or havent seen her before. Now im not sure if im prejudice against kyle. Aita for ruining my friend's relationship?

AutoModerator,"**Back in Westeros**  

^(GRRM, AUGUST 15, 2020 AT 9:10 AM)

I am back in my fortress of solitude again, my isolated mountain cabin.   I‚Äôd returned to Santa Fe for a short visit, to spend some time with Parris, deal with some local business that had piled up during my months away, and of course fulfill my duties to CoNZealand, the virtual worldcon.   But all that is behind me now, and I am back on the mountain again‚Ä¶ which means I am back in Westeros again, once more moving ahead with WINDS OF WINTER.

It is curious how my life has evolved.  I mean, once upon a time, I actually wrote my books and stories in the house where I lived, in a home office.   But some decades ago, wanting more solitude, I bought the house across the street and made THAT my writer‚Äôs retreat.   No longer would I write all day in my red flannel bathrobe; now I would have to dress and put on shoes and walk all the way across the street to write.  But that worked for a while.

Things started getting busier, though.   So busy that I needed a full-time assistant.   Then the office house had someone else in it, not just me and my characters.   And then I hired a second assistant, and a third, and‚Ä¶ there was more mail, more email, more phone calls (we put in a new phone system), more people coming by.   By now I am up to five assistants‚Ä¶ and somewhere in there I also acquired a movie theatre, a bookstore, a charitable foundation, investments, a business manager‚Ä¶ and‚Ä¶

Despite all the help, I was drowning till I found the mountain cabin.

My life up here is very boring, it must be said.  Truth be told, I hardly can be said to have a life.   I have one assistant with me at all times (minions, I call them).  The assistants do two-week shifts, and have to stay in quarantine at home before starting a shift.   Everyone morning I wake up and go straight to the computer, where my minion brings me coffee (I am utterly useless and incoherent without my morning coffee) and juice, and sometimes a light breakfast.  Then I start to write.   Sometimes I stay at it until dark.   Other days I break off in late afternoon to answer emails or return urgent phone calls.   My assistant brings me food and drink from time to time.   When I finally break off for the day, usually around sunset, there‚Äôs dinner.   Then we watch television or screen a movie.  The wi-fi sucks up on the mountain, though, so the choices are limited.   Some nights I read instead.   I always read a bit before going to sleep; when a book really grabs hold of me, I may read half the night, but that‚Äôs rare.

I sleep.  The next day, I wake up, and do the same.  The next day, the next day, the next day.   Before Covid, I would usually get out once a week or so to eat at a restaurant or go to the movies.   That all ended in March.   Since then, weeks and months go by when I never leave the cabin, or see another human being except whoever is on duty that week.  I lose track of what day it is, what week it is, what month it is.   The time seems to by very fast.   It is now August, and I don‚Äôt know what happened to July.

But it is good for the writing.

And you know, now that I reflect on it, I am coming to realize that has always been my pattern.   I moved to Santa Fe at the end of 1979, from Dubuque, Iowa.   My first marriage broke up just before that move, so I arrived in my new house alone, in a town where I knew almost no one.   Roger Zelazny was here, and he became a great friend and mentor, but Roger was married with small kids, so I really did not see him often.   There was no fandom in Santa Fe; that was all down in Albuquerque, an hour away.  I went to the club meetings every month, but that was only one night a month, and required two hours on the road.   And I had no job to meet new people.   My job was in the back room at the house on Declovina Street, so that was where I spent my days.  At night, I watched television.   Alone.   Sometimes I went to the movies.   Alone.

That was my life from December 1979 through September 1981, when Parris finally moved to Santa Fe, following Denvention.   (Not quite so bleak, maybe, I did make some local friends by late 1980 and early 1981, but it was a slow process).   When I think back on my life in 1980-1981, the memories seem to be made up entirely of conventions, interspersed with episodes of LOU GRANT and WKRP IN CINCINNATI.

Ah, but work wise, that same period was tremendously productive for me.   Lisa and I finished WINDHAVEN during that time, Gardner and I did a lot of work on ‚ÄúShadow Twin,‚Äù and then I went right on and wrote all of FEVRE DREAM.   Some short stories as well.     My life, such that it was, was lived in my head, and on the page.

I wonder if it is the same for other writers?   Or is it just me?   I wonder if I will ever figure out the secret of having a life and writing a book at the very same time.

I certainly have not figured it out to date.

For the nonce, it is what it is.   My life is at home, on hold, and I am spending the days in Westeros with my pals Mel and Sam and Vic and  Ty.    And that girl with no name, over there in Braavos.

 &gt;After the Haitians gained independence from French colonial rule in the Haitian Revolution of 1804, the French returned in 1825 and demanded that the newly independent country pay the French government and French slaveholders the modern equivalent of US$21 billion for claiming slaveowner's property and the land that they had turned into profitable sugar and coffee producing plantations. This independence debt was financed by French banks and the American Citibank, and finally paid off in 1947. Later, the corrupt Duvalier dynasty added to the country's debts, and is believed to have used the money to expand their power and for their personal benefits.

When I started working, lot's of sitting of course - quickly gained 30kg (90-&gt;120) for 2 years (23-&gt;25yo) - caused huge impact on health.

Now, 32yo, daily routine consists of 

\- 2 x 4 km walking to office (yes, I prefer visiting office even almost everyone working remotely)

\- every 1.5-2 hour 15 min break for coffee, and pull-ups (as we have bar in the office) or several turkish get-ups with 32kg kettlebel

Edit: Personally, I'd like to add that I am a advocate of Marijuana, not against it at all for my own reasons.

 Fortunately, I'm also free to ""partake"", as I'm not on probation that stipulates that I don't.

The silvia being worked only during rush hours won't earn that profit, maybe just break even.  

If the coffee order is like 1 cup every 10-15mins throughout the entire day; yeah, non-commercial group you can still make it worthwhile.  

But if only first 3 hours and you have to do multiple rapid back-to-back drinks; you need an efficient commercial machine that can handle that as well as an established workflow.

The only control men have in these situations is literally always wearing a condom until they are ready to have children or if an unexpected pregnancy arises, they know they can handle it. Not all birth control is full proof anyway.",1643280497,huf9pf7,1,AmItheAsshole,2022-01-27T10:48:17Z

GoAwayCloser,"Hi everyone! I am 40F, 82 kg, doing ADF for 10days now. I have been doing IF before, mainly 5:2 and it was the only thing that helped me lose wait.
So started again on Jan 17, this time ADF,  also with 5 workouts a week (mostly cardio).
The first week was great, I dropped almost 3kg but now is my second week and actually my weight is going up compared to the first one. Started 83.4 kg (but I was bloated, on my period so I assume I was more around 82.5 really), lowest point last week was 80.7 kg, so I thought I will drop below 80 after two more 36 hours fasts but sadly, no. Today I am 81.7 and frankly, I am little disappointed. Is it too early to expect results? I see other people here have amazing results just two weeks in and I really hoped that I will too. Also having results early in the beginning keeps my motivation high.
 
I have no problem with the fasts - I do only herbal tea, water and coffee, on eating days I aim at 1500 ccal and try to eat clean.

 Maybe I should be more patient, I guess.

rose_riveter,"My dad was mentally ill but functional, went to MIT, could fly a plane, drive a race car, ski and ski jump, keep a job, get up early and go despite bigotry in a small town in mid 1900s, he was fairly well-liked. It was still sad to see him lose the plot. His father paid for him to be in a private hospital which meant he could bounce back quickly. I would ride in the car with him to stores or bushwacking and be quiet and kind. 

When his father died they sold the family business and my dad had to go to the state hospital where they overdosed him to the point of drooling. He cried with humiliation when we visited and saw him that way.

My mother hadn't known his diagnosis when they married and was so angry she basically threw a lifelong tantrum until she died at 50 from cancer. A lifetime spent starving herself to stay thin, mixing muscle relaxants with fortified wine, cigarettes and cheap instant coffee.

She refused to speak to any of the neighbor women whose kids I played with. They were ""fat and ugly but still had the nerve to tell me to get a job in case he can't support us.""

Luckily they were so nice they did not hold it against me and never said anything at all about either of my parents.

AggravatingPatient18,"I was one of the few that said you weren't an arsehole. 

Your adopted parents were frightened, and when you made contact with your bio parents they lashed out at you and withdrew, upset at  the perceived betrayal. Yes they did the hard yards to raise you and paid for your education. But they made a conscious decision and signed a commitment to do this when they first adopted you. You do not need to feel anymore grateful to them then if your bio parents had done the same thing.

So after the rift then you maintained contact with your bio parents and that relationship grew into something strong over 7 years. This ebb and flow happens with all relationships, and because you have a physical resemblances and personality traits that come from your shared DNA of course it is likely you are going to get along well with your bio family.

What to do? It is clear you are going to have to make all the effort to maintain a relationship with your adoptive parents. They are like snails or turtles who withdraw into their shell at the first sign of danger. Coax them out, take them for coffee and catch them up on your wonderful life, without mentioning for your bio parents involvement.   Acknowledge the great upbringing they gave you.  Once they bring it up,  let them know that you never meant for them to reject you when you found your bio parents and that upsets you too. Would you say that your dream goal would be to have both sets of parents as friends?

Get some counselling, then ask your adopted parents along for a group session. I don't want to diagnose them that they do sound quite passive-aggressive so its probably very unlikely for them to acknowledge any part in the rift between you. I suspect the best you can hope for is a cordial relationship.  Ask your adopted dad to take you down the aisle by himself or just go by yourself. Make sure mum has a special role too.   But the payoff is that your bio family are also acknowledged and have parts in the wedding. 

Do you think your mum and dad would agree to this? Or do they want you to cut yourself off from your bio relatives?",1643279471,huf8f1x,1,TrueOffMyChest,2022-01-27T10:31:11Z

ankh87,"The issue is what would you deem as a decent wage? 

  
I have (much younger) friends who work in IT for NHS who are on around ¬£10.50 an hour. The new minimum wage is going up to ¬£9.50 an hour this year. My friends have been to school (college) to get whatever qualification they needed to do this IT job. Now they are only going to be getting ¬£1 more than someone who possibly dropped out, couldn't be bothered and is now say stacking shelves, serving coffee or whatever. I'm not saying that all the people working these jobs are like this just giving an example. 

&amp;#x200B;

So overall the pay for all jobs is completely off.  How is it fair that someone who spent time to learn a craft is getting paid just ¬£1 more than someone who hasn't. Then if we factor in what you are wanting then every wage would need to be increased. 

If you say people getting minimum should be on ¬£10.50 an hour to make it reasonable, then those who are in that IT job should be on ¬£13 an hour, then the people above them (i assume there is a higher job) should be on ¬£16 and so on. 

It gets to a point where your entry level jobs are on the same pay as someone who is say on the next level at the current moment.

This may not be helpful and may be tone deaf, so apologies in advance. But my friends with children are envious of my husband and I in that we can go out for food whenever and spend money on whatever we want and go on holidays and weekend breaks whenever we want.

 If I needed to take a mid day nap I would wear it. Anytime I got into bed for any amount of time I would put it on.

One day, a seemingly single and lonely guy with nice looks and manly attitude shows up in your place, and from now on he starts simping you systematically (things such as gifting you a coffee, complimenting you about your cheerful behaviour), as if he somehow understood you were already taken yet tried to win your heart.
He's always buying something and trying to have a chat with you, he leaves you alone only if you're busy.

You get to know he behaves like that with other people too. He sometimes complains he can't seem to find a girl that is not already taken.
You also get to know he already asked out one of your colleagues and got rejected due to her being already in a relationship.

How would you act if that kept going on for months? Mind you, no creepy/stalkerish behaviour at all, as if that guy knows the law and is deliberately trying to make this go on as long as possible until he gets what he wants?

He doesn't seem obsessioned in you, rather obsessioned in the idea of having a girlfriend. He's always gentle and respectful, he always act confident and never ever sexually desperate. He's basically hell bent in getting to be more than a friend for a girl.

Interesting-Gear-819,"&gt;That was when I realized how easy it is to get addicted. 

I really urge anyone out there who drinks coffee. ""Because you always did it"" or ""everyone else does it"". Try drinking not a single cup for 2-3 days. No other products with caffeine either obviously and don't break your normal circle. Not drinking coffee on weekends is a different thing ...

  
If you feel (slightly) shitty just because of the lack of your coffee. Imagine it a hundred times worse when you are addicted to e.g. Heroin. Addiction doesn't have to happen ""suddenly"" but can also come slowly, over time. Some fall easier for it, others struggle less but nobody is immune, that's how we work.

* Pay in dollars (the Colombian peso is devaluated)
* Pay the salary on time (ALWAYS)
* Offer remote work + possible coworking spaces (If possible)
* Give at least 15 days of paid holidays (15 days are mandatory)
* Respect the 8-hours schedules. If necessary, there are regulations for extra-hours and Sunday hours
* Offer bonuses for taking certifications, e.g. AWS, Scrum...
* Always say 'hi' to every single employee as you want to be greeted
* Get involved in conversations. Coffee chats may encourage good relations. Notice, coffee is super important for us.
* Encourage teamwork
* Afterwork beer on Fridays are a thing, take the initiative to invite your employees
* Colombia is a diverse country. You may work with people of all shapes, colours, genders. Enjoy diversity.
* Be aware, there are certain events that everyone wants to attend. For example, when the national football team plays.
* Try to provide the instructions as explicitly as possible, and always write them.

Don'ts:

* Never miss a salary payment (like NEVER)
* Nobody cares about Christmas or integration parties, save that money to ensure nice working conditions
* Never encourage competition among colleagues
* Never do illegal contracts, there are harsh consequences. E.g. hiring someone without EPS/ARL.

If you live to the average life expectancy of 80, and you inherit $1 million now at age 25, that's going to be $15k to spend a year.

$15k a year is enough for food and the latest iPhone. Unless you live for yourself for 60 years, add in a few children and assume the wife works. 15k a year is nothing.

$1 million is a crazy amount in your 20s. Go on a nice 4 week holiday, save or invest $950k.

I'm 34 and have saved up 400k living simply and focusing on work. I'm still ""young"" but all of a sudden I can finally travel and have a steady source of passive income. $100 a week. It's not much, but I like to think it covers my coffee money for the rest of my life. Have a kid now. Married.",1643277843,huf6ecd,1,SelfAwarewolves,2022-01-27T10:04:03Z

I'm thinking of getting rid of the coffee caramel glaze and replacing it with orange glaze. Then, instead of having a faux egg (which I did by accident, but by the time I had it plated I was determined to finish it lol) maybe do a molded and formed filled mousse. I also think moving the ice cream to the side of the tart would help in showcasing the tart as the focal point, and instead of decorating the whole tart, maybe just decorate the edges.

Straws are not a necessity. No straw, drink from cup. No problem. Reducing something that is not needed is perfectly fine.

But, no bag use what? Stuff inside your shirt and underwear?

He prepared the coffee and washed the dishes, he is super clean and likes tidying up staff... Super zen personality that just calms me.

I asked him if he wanted to stay for a weekend I was not there, but he refused, he respects this is my space and my flat. 

Finally, he could not get to the hostel because he didn't have the vaccine back then, he wrote me that he didn't have where to go and if he could stay at my place while he finds somewhere to live.

nametab23,"&gt;Main/honest answer first - because I only vaguely recall metadata legislation happening, must or have caught my attention whereas a QR code is hard to miss.

Thank you for being honest about this element. I was literally shut down my 3 people on Facebook at the time of metadata retention, who bought into the anti-terrorism rhetoric and said *'if you've got nothing to hide, you shouldn't be worried'*. 

They're ex-colleagues + very extended family.. Not close social circle. However you can imagine how ironic I found it that those same people are now 'outraged' by QR codes and the 'invasion of privacy'. 


&gt;Small additional thought - metadata may link you to a certain tower at a certain time, but it doesn't show whether you were in a strip club or the coffee shop around the corner.

I would suggest you investigate what can be derived or obtained through metadata, before following that thought.",1643277535,huf60l9,1,CoronavirusDownunder,2022-01-27T09:58:55Z
ParkingPsychology,"&gt; Anxious to work after sexual harassment.

[Here's a 2 minute test](https://psychcentral.com/quizzes/anxiety-quiz/) you can take, that will test you for anxiety. It let's you know roughly where you rank in severity (if it comes back relatively low, it might be social anxiety, for example).

[Here are a few things that you can do to help you with general anxiety](https://old.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/wiki/onlineresources). It comes down to meditation, breathing exercises and using phone apps to reduce your anxiety.

You can double check if it is indeed general anxiety here: [11 Signs and Symptoms of Anxiety Disorders](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/anxiety-disorder-symptoms)

If you feel anxious right now, [open this image](https://i.imgur.com/Huou7Gh.gif) in a new tab and start breathing in and out in the rhythm of the image.

There are a *large* number of books that are aimed specifically at helping you, I've selected the most popular ones for you:

* [The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook](https://www.amazon.com/Anxiety-Phobia-Workbook-Edmund-Bourne/dp/1626252157/) (4.6 stars, 1200+ ratings)
* [Dare: The New Way to End Anxiety and Stop Panic Attacks](https://www.amazon.com/Dare-Anxiety-Stop-Panic-Attacks/dp/0956596258) (4.7 stars, 1600+ ratings)
* [Badass Ways to End Anxiety &amp; Stop Panic Attacks! - A counterintuitive approach to recover and regain control of your life.: Die-Hard and Science-Based ... recover from Anxiety and Stop Panic Attacks](https://www.amazon.com/Badass-Ways-Anxiety-Panic-Attacks/dp/9090305262) (4.7 stars, 400+ ratings)

If you currently consume a lot of caffeine (in coffee or soft drinks), stop that. [Caffeine is known to cause anxiety](https://bebrainfit.com/caffeine-anxiety/)

The best and quickest way to deal with anxiety, is to face your fear if possible.

[If you always avoid situations that scare you](https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/publications/overcome-fear-anxiety/), you might stop doing things you want or need to do. You won't be able to test out whether the situation is always as bad as you expect, so you miss the chance to work out how to manage your fears and reduce your anxiety. Anxiety problems tend to increase if you get into this pattern. Exposing yourself to your fears can be an effective way of overcoming this anxiety.

*[The experience of anxiety involves nervous system arousal.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/insight-therapy/201009/overcoming-fear-the-only-way-out-is-through) If your nervous system is not aroused, you cannot experience anxiety. Understandably, but unfortunately, most people attempt to cope with feelings of anxiety by avoiding situations or objects that cause the feelings. Avoidance, however, prevents your nervous system from getting used to it. So avoidance guarantees that the feared object or situation will remain new, and hence arousing, and hence anxiety provoking. Even worse, avoidance will generalize over time. If you avoid the elevator at work, you will soon begin to avoid all elevators, and then all buildings that house elevators. Soon enough, you'll be living in a prison of avoidance.*

If your anxiety is situational and not too extreme, you can try to address it through exposure therapy. You slowly carefully expose yourself to situations that you know give you fear. Here are two easy to follow guides on that. The one regarding spiders, is a blue print. You can replace spider with anything. Fear of driving. Fear of using a phone.

* [How to Overcome the Fear of Spiders](https://www.wikihow.com/Overcome-the-Fear-of-Spiders) (wikihow)
* [How to Overcome Fear](https://www.wikihow.com/Overcome-Fear) (wikihow)

For all of the below advice, use technology to your advantage. Take your phone and set repeating alarm clock reminders, with labels of what to do. Train yourself to either snooze or reschedule the reminders if you can't take action right away, but never to ignore them. The intention is [to condition yourself](https://www.cleverism.com/classical-conditioning/), to build habits, so you will start healing yourself without having to think about it.

* **Sleep**: [Good sleep is very important when treating anxiety](https://www.anxiety.org/sleep-a-fundamental-cure-for-anxiety)
When you have days where you don't have to do anything, don't oversleep, set an alarm clock. You really don't need more than 7 hours at most per night (a [little more](https://health.onehowto.com/article/how-many-hours-of-sleep-are-needed-per-night-by-age-8233.html) if you are under 18). If you can't fall sleep, try taking melatonin one hour before going to bed. It's [cheap](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003JJ9TQA/), OTC and [is scientifically proven](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-940/melatonin) to help regulate your sleep pattern. [Also, rule](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-apnea/news/20120330/sleep-apnea-linked-depression#1) out [sleep apnea](https://www.healthcentral.com/article/sleep-apnea-treatment-resistant-depression). Up to 6% of people have this, [but not everyone knows](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-apnea/features/sleep-apnea-clues#1). If you find yourself often awake at night, start counting. Don't grab your phone, don't look at the clock, don't do anything interesting. We're trying to *bore* you to sleep, not keep you entertained - sometimes it might *feel* like you've done it for hours and hours, but often it's really not all that long. Anytime your mind wanders away from the numbers and starts thinking, start over at 1. count at the speed of either your heartbeat or your breathing, whatever you prefer. Then both Alexa and Google Home can also play a range of sleep sounds if you ask them (rain or other white noise) and there are also free apps for both Android and Apple devices.
* **Meditate**: [Anxiety can be reduced with meditation](https://bebrainfit.com/meditation-anxiety/). [10 minute meditation for anxiety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-6f5wQXSu8) (youtube). 
Your attention is like a muscle. The more you train it, the better the control you have over it. [Mindfulness training](https://www.mindful.org/meditation/mindfulness-getting-started/) will help you gain better control over your mind. It doesn't take much effort, just 15 to 20 minutes a day of doing nothing but focus your attention is enough and is scientifically proven to work. As you become better at focusing your attention, it will become easier to force yourself to stop having negative thoughts, which will break the negative reinforcement cycle. Go here if you have specific questions: /r/Meditation
* **Exercise**: [The effect of exercise on anxiety](https://www.calmclinic.com/anxiety/treatment/exercising) 
If you have access to a gym, then start lifting weights. If you don't have access to a gym (or you don't like lifting), start running. If you can't run, then start walking. Just start small. 10 minutes three times a week is fine. You don't have to run fast, just run and then slowly build it up over time. Exercising does several things: It releases endorphins, it takes your mind of your negative thoughts and it will improve your overall health.
* **Give lots of hugs**: [Hugs release oxytocin](https://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-wellness/articles/2016-02-03/the-health-benefits-of-hugging), which improves your mood and relaxes you. So find people to hug. If you are single, hug your parents or friends. If you can't, see if a dog is an option. Most dogs love to hug. Another solution that provides the same benefit is a [weighted blanket](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=weighted+blanket) will provide a [similar positive effect at night](https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety/do-weighted-blankets-work#benefits). [You should try to aim for 12 hugs a day](https://psychology-spot.com/brain-needs/) (if you currently don't hug a lot, I suggest you slowly build it up over time).

[Be aware that anxiety can be addictive](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/emotional-freedom/201104/are-you-addicted-anxiety-learn-how-not-be):

&gt;I've seen that many people are addicted to the adrenaline rush of anxiety, known as ""the fight or flight response"" and don't know how to diffuse it.

[Frequent consumpton of news (current events) can increase your anxiety](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00332747.2015.1069658).

As for cost, if you're both in it for the fun first, then you can agree to split the bill. And you can pick something less expensive, if you prefer. Put the focus on the activity, on your own fun. Meeting the other person is a byproduct.

Lastly, if the activity doesn't require pre-ordering, then you don't have to commit to it in advance.

* Corey Taylor (lead singer of Slipknot, Stone Sour). Absolutely brilliant guy, met a few times both at organised meet &amp; greets and also 'in the wild'. Always happy to talk and crack a joke.
* Lemmy (Motorhead). Pointed at my Motorhead t-shirt and said ""they're shit!"" and cracked up laughing. 
* Alexi Laiho (Children of Bodom). Absolutely tiny, seriously like barely 5'. Very nice and softly spoken but quite friendly. Shocked to hear of his passing last year - RIP.
* Kevin Whately (Auf Wiedersehen Pet, Lewis). Really nice guy, very engaging in conversation. Same can be said for Tim Healy.
* Gazza. Really nice, stood next to him in a bar (he was drinking coffee) and he insisted I got served before him even though he'd been stood longer.
* Dean Richards (Newcastle Falcons). Met a few times at matches. Was waiting in arrivals at Newcastle airport one evening waiting to pick my girlfriend up from holiday &amp; he saw my Falcons shirt and came over to chat for a good 5-10 minutes. 
* Chubby Brown. Met him 'in the wild' whilst out shopping with my Mother. Absolute gentleman, his stage persona precedes him massively &amp; when not on stage the man is totally different. A couple of blokes saw him while he was talking to us &amp; started to get a bit leary - Chubby asked them to ""mind your language in front of the lady please"".

* Most of the England rugby squad. Met most players across the Eddie Jones era &amp; most are really lovely guys who are more than happy to give back to the fans.

If you are young and without commitments (kids etc) then read, play, build, repeat. You will get hired. My first 2 and half years of jobs (3 of them) were incremental steps up in shitty IT departments for small companies.

 I did what I had to in the jobs then spent the rest of the time paying with tech that interested me. Look for ways to automate shitty work. It is hard to tell you are slacking when your slacking is learning a new language or building lab servers from discarded old machines. You lab can be an power extension cord and some machines under your desk/coffee table.

This worked for me as I was young, no kids and my gf was at uni across the country. I actually enjoy learning about tech and playing with it. I moved cities for all the next set of jobs, to maximise my chances of finding something. I lived in shitty flat shares with random people when i moved. 

I don't think I would have the energy to have done with once i had kids. It wasn't a chore when I was young, I didn't ever have to worry about dividing my time with work/partner/kids.

keep-d-change,"What was your budget before and where? That way a comparison can be drawn to make sure you don't see a drop in your lifestyle/comfort level.

Lifestyle is the big determinator. Are you used to going out to eat or grabbing take away, having a cleaner, dressing in a certain way, personal grooming, etc...

The petrol is for a car, right? Your mileage may vary, but fuel is often one of the more negligible costs of car ownership. FYI: I spend about 70 a month in petrol, but the other 130 does not even begin to cover the other costs: the car itself, insurance, road tax, yearly maintenance, tyre changes twice a year, parking... As a reference point, I paid 1100 to get a new set of winter wheels (Michelin and the cheapest rims I could find) installed in October on a small SUV - hopefully the tyres will be OK for 3 winters and now I just need to pay the manual labour of changing the wheels from winter-summer-winter. Don't even get me started on parking costs. I flew to see my family in November, the car park at the airport was more expensive than the plane ticket üòÇ (no early morning public transport option from our city to the airport, small kids/luggage...)

Entertainment can be a big cost. for example, date night with spouse, cultural events... Usually we spend 100-300 a month on 'us'. 200 on a nice chef's menu 3 course dinner with wine and 60 (30*2) for a comedy show. Even cheap lunch (25 each) and a movie and soft drink is setting you back 100 or more. We didn't have this type of expense for a few years (COVID, small kids, budget restrictions) but ultimately not having fun was having a negative impact on our wellbeing and relationship. We don't need to pay childcare for these small outings, as we have friends that cover it. We also often just have BBQs and brunches where friends eat/drink/chill together. 

Activities with the child can easily add up to 3 digits every month. We try to go swimming every weekend, just at our local pool. Entry is 12*2 for the adults, kids under 4 don't pay. One adult is on kid duty and the other swims and we switch. Indoor play/activity center is 16 per kid, adults don't pay. These are just simple things to do in winter to keep the kids active for an hour or two and for us to get out of the house and break up the day (we live in a flat and so have no garden). You can then jazz it up and do fancy things like skiing or expensive sports/activities. In summer the parks are fun and free, so that helps, but outdoor pools are still mostly paid. If you're looking into activities for your child these will also be charged, we find it's about 250 for 1*45 minutes once week courses that last 8 weeks (martial arts, swim classes, etc).

Assuming you're not local, how expensive is it for you guys to travel to your family and how often do you plan on going? Holidays in or out of CH easily run up 1000+ for 5 days.

Personal items, the portion of health costs paid out of your pocket, etc... It all adds up++++

Groceries are a huge variable. Just bought spent 60 CHF on official bin (trash) bags. I shop at Lidl (120-150 a week) and coop (30-50 a week) and this is only for 'fresh' food. I could cut this amount by switching out the organic food for cheaper variants, and simply not buying things like papaya, raspberries, fancy cheeses etc. I go to Germany and spend about 250 EUR every 6-8 weeks for items that last longer (long shelf life like roasted coffee beans, pasta/rice, sauces, meat (we have a deep freezer) household cleaning and personal hygiene). We don't spend much on food apart from the supermarket, we almost never do things like 'grab a starbucks latte', 'let's order pizza' and we usually bring lunch/snacks from home.

If I look at my own life pay less than your budget for rent in a 5-room apartment (not in Z√ºrich, obviously) but more for everything else. But yeah, maybe totally different lifestyle as we're dual income and everyone lives differently. We have above average income and even after savings we have disposable income to use.

Just thinking of misc, I'd probably need to double it. But that's because I am thinking not only of monthly bills, but overall expenses that I need to consider even if I only buy things once and it lasts a few years, I still need to calculate for it (computer, phone, coffee machine, etc). expenses that come to mind: taxes (also 120 a year for an accountant), fiber internet, mobile phone subscriptions, insurances galore (legal, renters association, third party liability, car, supplementary health, etc), gym/sports fees, digital services like Netflix/Disney/Masterclass/Prime/VPN/Google photos, etc. Recycling services, TV licence, haircuts/personal services, clothes for ourselves/kids, toys (kids things like buying a random Tonies or Duplo and adults things like new wireless headset for the laptop)...

I won't even mention childcare costs as to not scare anyone and because I don't know if you'll need it. But it's comparable to your rent budget if you need to get childcare 5 days a week for a 4 year old before/after Kindergarten.",1643277281,huf5pgv,1,zurich,2022-01-27T09:54:41Z

moldybuttcheese,"I think the breakfast idea would actually work out with a savory tart! I might experiment around with that idea in the future. Considering it's a dessert this time, I agree with getting rid of the gel filled mousse (or maybe do that as a filled, formed mousse so it doesn't look like an egg). Maybe I take the ice cream and put it to the side of the tart and just decorate the border of the tart so that it's showcased better as the focal point of the dish. Then maybe instead of having so many different flavors simplify it down and do a orange glaze instead of coffee caramel, maybe keep the coffee ice cream? I'm in really early stages of planning a restaurant ATM so I've been experimenting and doing tons of trial and error.

blindedge,"Closer but also slightly inaccurate, bean for bean the caffeine content is pretty similar since caffeine is pretty stable at roasting temperatures, the darker the roast the less dense it is because it's giving off some water but primarily CO2. More CO2 is also given off when the coffee is rested (again a larger amount from a darker roast, which is why you generally want to rest dark roasts longer).

GeelongJr,"Well first of all it depends on where you work. If you're American, then obviously the North-East is going to have fancier dressing than somewhere like San Francisco, Austin or Atlanta. Europe is generally a lot more formal than the US. Many people still wear suits and ties in London, as opposed to the suit with no tie look which is more common in the US. Somewhere like Milan or Paris are a lot fancier in general but they are fashion capitals for a reason. In Japan 

I live in Sydney at the moment, and I think it's in between. If you go to a networking/drinks event, most people will be wearing suits or at least a sports coat. Even more relaxed events like the celebratory awards night at the local footy club are going to have a blazer dress code. Going to the horse/greyhound racing is pretty common, most people are wearing suits/blazers there. But yeah, you don't want to be showing up to a coffee chat with a superior or someone you're looking to get to know in the professional world in just a t-shirt. If you work in IT or Tech that's probably different though. 

As for the more dressy things, i.e. wearing a tie with a suit or a tuxedo, it's mostly going to be community events, politics, fundraising or university. All of these things have balls, which are black tie. I'm just a normal guy, went to a public school but I do like to be active in the community and meet new people, and I had to whack on the tux a fair few times last year. 3 of which were university balls. 

I'd say the rule is that if you are having drinks/a social night, with other professionals or aspirational professionals, you normally wear a blazer or a suit without a tie. This is everyone standing up and having a beer, there's often a speaker invited. I don't know if this is done in the US (assuming you're from there) because you don't really have a pub culture. But if you go to a pub during the day in the CBD of London, Sydney, Melbourne it's going to be a lot of people in suits. It's not a dress code as much as it is an unwritten rule for gatherings. 

If it's a more serious thing, I don't know maybe a more formal networking event or dinner at a really nice place, you wear a tie. Just as a way to show respect. There's definitely been a couple times where I've been unsure and have had to untie the tie and put that shit in my pocket. 

Black tie is very niche. You don't wear it unless it specifically says 'BLACK TIE'. So a ball/fundraising night basically (think charity nights). It's essentially a costume, you only wear it for these nights and for nothing else, it's super unprofessional. 

Sorry for the long-winded response. Basically, the long-winded answer is that wearing at least a jacket is considered the socially accepted norm for gatherings/meetings amongst people of a traditional white collar background/aspirations. Of course if you're just meeting your mate that you work with or going out to tea with a couple people from the same industry you probably aren't going to get suited up, but many do still.",1643276978,huf5c5y,1,malefashionadvice,2022-01-27T09:49:38Z

UBDSRadar190129803,"I'm going to give this advice assuming you have zero discernment even if that might not be true.

Safety:

1. Let a trusted friend know where you're going, including the address. I hate bringing this up because it's an uncomfortable thought, but if something whack goes down, tell the dude somebody knows exactly where you are. That usually rebuffs anything criminal because they know they'll be caught.
2. FaceTime with the guy before you meet
3. If you still feel uneasy, meet up in a public space to begin, like a bar or coffee shop. A park at midnight does not count.
4. Carry a deterrent or weapon. Most gay guys will look at you oddly for suggesting it, but many law-abiding citizens--from liberal metropolitan feminist and Hilbilly Jim both--carry everything from pepper spray to a concealed carry. Better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it. 
5. Your health is more important than giving a stranger the benefit of the doubt. Many guys are educated and proactive, but some will lie about their diligence in testing for STDs and taking prep. Be safe.

Pleasure/Hygiene:

1. Make sure you have good hygiene. Even if you're a virgin, if you're a bottom, figure that shit out. 
2. Confirm who has/is bringing lube and domes beforehand.
3. Lots of foreplay.
4. Make sure you're on the same wavelength in terms of what you want/expect. 
5. Don't be coerced into doing something you're not comfortable with because more often than not, you will regret it.",1643276794,huf53uo,1,grindr,2022-01-27T09:46:34Z

I see the planner is getting a lot of flak, but I personally really like it. I like things that affect the real life in small ways, it puts smile on my face. In my country it's only ¬£0.79, and so I enjoy supporting the game which I play daily.

I personaly find it strange that so many people complain about the game that is free to play, and saying that the developers are greedy. I mean, it is business at the end of a day, and they need to get revenue. Things in life are not free, it's just the way it is. Are the coffee shops greedy because they charge for coffee? Are the cinemas greedy, because they charge for watching movies? Are the game developers greedy, because they charge you 30-60$ for a game which you will pass in 20-80 hours?

They have to attract the ways players will spend the money on the game, and in my eyes it is not greedy.  I don't know how many hours I spend in PC, but definitely hundreds. I never bought the leaf tickets, or the furniture plan, because for me it is not enough value for money, but I enjoy happy helper plan, and this one.

HumbleParticular3,"First of all, good on you for dedicating your energy to yourself and your healing, and approaching a therapist to help guide you through. &lt;3

I‚Äôve gone through a 5 month consciously celibate period after jumping from hook up to fwb to date for years. Hardly ever in a committed relationship, and also hardly ever completely on my own/single. In the celibate period I didn‚Äôt even masturbate, went fully into nun mode lol. Felt great, learned a lot, all good and happy.
And then at some point I felt like I would like someone in my life again, because in the end I don‚Äôt think all healing needs to be done solo. And then the pandemic hit, lockdown etc, couldn‚Äôt see and hug my friends anymore like many of us, and I thought ugh I didn‚Äôt mean to be THIS celibate. And then I started dating again.

Sooo that‚Äôs my story, a bit lenghty. Bottom line is that for me, the curiosity about dating just came back naturally. And once I had had a few innocent coffee dates I felt ready for intimacy. And after a bit of that I felt ready for a longer lasting fwb. And a few months into that I realised that I felt ready to open up more and fall in love again. There‚Äôs no rush, you can take all the time you need! And if you think you might be ready but aren‚Äôt quite sure, you can always try going on an easy, light-hearted date to see how it feels. You don‚Äôt owe anyone anything, you are always allowed to adjust the sails as you go.

MarcoRod,"I find this whole ""just look for a mentor"" thing pretty weird.

Like sure, I'm a mentor to a few of my friends who do similar stuff. I'm a mentor to some former clients still.

But let's be totally honest here: there aren't ""mentors"" out there that just wait to be contacted and then devote considerable time to someone for free.

Whenever I hear people in videos say ""yo, go out there and get a mentor, offer them a coffee"" I'm like, yeah, no that's not going to work. It might work in 1% or 0.1% of the cases, but that's it.

Don't get me wrong, I get a ton of emails, DMs and people asking for help and I'm happy to respond to anyone, but being a real ""mentor"" in that sense is just not practical for absolute strangers.

Actual consulting is a different story of course, but that's not what I mean with mentorship in that sense.",1643276163,huf4c9p,1,ecommerce,2022-01-27T09:36:03Z

RhymesWithLasagna,"Not at all!!!

If you can have fun with friends dancing or doing whatever without alcohol, you are saving your health, liver, and your dignity by not doing stupid stuff drunk. You are less likely to die young in some accident. I used to drink to have confidence because I was shy, but once I got over feeling everyone was looking at me, it was so nice to not waste so much money on a night out (liquor is expensive) and to be functional rather than hungover the next day! 

Smoking is super hard to quit. My husband could have bought a house with the money he's spend on tobacco products. Granted, one in this small country and a house somewhere far from the big cities, but still. He started because a friend told him coffee with cigarettes tastes amazing.. he didn't think he'd become addicted and now it's been 25 years and he's struggling to cut down and quit. It feels like a crutch that he can't get rid of. Not starting that will save you money, health, and you'll have better breath and teeth! Love my husband, but his teeth are terrible because of smoking... 

And drugs? I haven't tried any besides marijuana. The rest of them scared me too much as the idea of not being in control of myself freaked me out. Then, I had a friend who spent one year taking drugs and partying after high school... it convinced me even more. I honestly believe she lost some IQ points or something. She's not dumb, but it's like she's not as quick as she was before. That freaked me out a lot. 

I feel like you think you might be missing out, but you are mostly saving your health, wallet, and if preventing addictions your relationships, too.

Do you feel you are missing out not partaking? And, what do you feel you are missing out on, if you do? Or, is this because others have said you're a fool?",1643276042,huf46x4,1,Advice,2022-01-27T09:34:02Z

Depends on who you are. Some people absolutely cannot tolerate vitamin D towards bedtime as it keeps them awake. Some can. So experiment there and find out what works for you, you can take it anytime *with food*. Best to make it your first meal of the day.

Zinc is best taken with your first meal as it can cause nausea. It doesn‚Äôt for me, so I take it with my coffee on an empty stomach. Some people use zinc along with magnesium at night for sleep (ZMA), but I find Zinc helps me be more motivated.

So story is, experiment with what works for you, but safest bet is vitamin D with your first meal of the day, and either do the same with zinc if it gives you nausea and if not with your morning coffee or whatever.

lightbulbcat,"Unionizing is not only about pay. It‚Äôs about what should be basic working rights. Stores turning off mobiles or closing due to callouts costs the company WAY more money daily than better pay and benefits would. If you actually saw the numbers you would understand. The world is unpredictable right now and people crave reliability and human interaction, both of which only happen if employees come to work and aren‚Äôt too overworked or stressed to make their customer connections! I have seen stores go from making $5000 to $3000 due to unreliability in store hours, as well as the only store in the district that stayed open the entirety of covid going from being the ‚Äúbusiest store in the district‚Äù to ‚Äúit‚Äôs so slammed it doesn‚Äôt matter if you have 9 people on the floor the machines are maxed out and wait times are 15 minutes.‚Äù Keep in mind this isn‚Äôt isolated to Starbucks, any fast food/coffee place that shuts down around us affects our business.

I will say Starbucks also actively acknowledges rising costs of operation, product, labor, etc. due to COVID and inflation by raising prices 10-50 cents (at the least, sometimes more) every quarter, hoping people are too distracted by the launch of new shiny product to care that their drinks cost more. It only works about half the time, trust me‚Ä¶ people are noticing. A box of hard boiled eggs with a slice of cheese and slimy squishy fruit costs over $6.00, almost double what it used to. Pennies to make, but just one by itself could cover a $1 raise for an average barista.

TheWizardOfFoz,"This reminds me of one my first forays into dating. Met a girl who was a friend of a friend and we were talking for month or so before things got a little more serious. Nudes were exchanged, texts got significantly more explicit and at one point she was even recommending porn to me.

Eventually I  broached the question about meeting in person. Asked if she wanted to get coffee or a meal. ‚ÄúLike a date?‚Äù, ‚ÄúSure.‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat makes you think I‚Äôm interested in you in that way?‚Äù.

I‚Äôve never been more confused. Ten years later and with a lot more experience in the dating game, now happily settled down, but those were still by far the strongest signals I‚Äôve ever gotten from a girl.",1643275143,huf32t0,1,Tinder,2022-01-27T09:19:03Z

sneakpeek_bot,"&gt; # HDB tour and ang ku kueh moulds: Little eye-openers on a walk around the heartland

&gt; What do Housing Board flats have to do with shophouses? Or with ang ku kueh moulds?

&gt; More than I would have thought, as it turns out. On a recent local walking tour, I also discover that spending a couple of hours ambling around the heartland can be more interesting than I would have imagined. (Yes, even if the new cooling measures may be squelching the property market.)

&gt; It is probably not a tour I would have considered signing up for, to be honest. The ""Evolution of Public Housing - An Architecture and History Tour through the Everton, Cantonment and Pinnacle Housing Estates"" sounds very much like an educational tour, something that only tourists and architectural or history students would be interested in.

&gt; Indeed, most of the guests joining tour guide Yeo Pei Shyuan on the walk have tended to be expatriates, students and locals who have not lived in a HDB flat. (""Crazy Rich Asians,"" we joke.)

&gt; But if you are looking for something a little different from the ""usual"" exploration of historical and heritage areas around Singapore - and a way to use up your SingapoRediscover Vouchers, which you will need to redeem by the end of December - this might be worth considering.

&gt; While more than 80 per cent of Singaporeans live in HDB flats, many may not know much about the story behind them or the evolution that they have gone through since HDB was set up in 1960 to provide homes for the bulk of the population.

&gt; Ms Yeo herself finds Singapore-style public housing intriguing. ""I've lived overseas for some years and seen public housing elsewhere. There is nothing like this on earth,"" she enthuses.

&gt; She grew up in Tiong Bahru - where the first public homes were built by the pre-war Singapore Improvement Trust - and now lives around Cantonment Road, the site of our two-hour walking tour.

&gt; This area, as she proceeds to show us, houses HDB flats from three eras.

&gt; The slab blocks in Everton Park reflect the ethos of early post-Independence years of public housing, when the priority was to build as many flats as possible.

&gt; ""They were all standardised so they could be built quickly, just like this,"" notes Ms Yeo, holding aloft the ang ku kueh mould.

&gt; At the same time, HDB was already giving some thought to building communities, and not just homes. Many of the blocks around Everton Park feature shops and coffee shops on the ground floor. ""They're modelled after shophouses,"" she points out.
