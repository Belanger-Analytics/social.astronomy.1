bodum gooseneck electric kettle, $27 on Amazon 

Your grinder is going to be your most expensive piece. I generally recommend the Baratza Encore as the cheapest unit that will do a good enough job. These run about $170. 

Your grinder is an investment, and is the most important piece of your coffee equipment. You can have the worlds most expensive coffee maker and a shitty grinder and you‚Äôll have mediocre coffee at best. You can have the worlds cheapest coffee maker and a killer grinder and you can make excellent top notch coffee, better than you can buy from most places",1643230975,hucif4s,ProgrammerHumor,2022-01-26T21:02:55Z

"Yeah it makes sense, and don't worry I almost never give bad reviews to Gig workers.  
The only time I gave a bad review meaning sub five-star to an instacart shopper was the one who delivered me completely the wrong grocery order, and then insisted he didn't.  
 I contacted instacart and got a refund,  but I still didn't have my groceries and instead I had 4 Party size boxes of mini muffins and coffee pods for a coffee maker I don't own  üòÇ  not exactly a balanced diet.

"I'm just sure where to start with this. 

I've got a regular old black &amp; decker coffee maker, drinking mostly pre ground coffee unless I break out my hand me down blade grinder. I'm not too picky with roast but I enjoy trying coffees at different shops because it always tastes a bit different. But, I also drink coffee at home largely for the caffeine for work, and I also enjoy random flavored coffee.

All that is to say, I'm no coffee geek, I just like coffee. 

But I do want to upgrade. I like to try new coffees, and I feel like the options are better and the flavor will be stronger if I go for freshly ground beans more often. So I started looking into a quality coffee grinder, knowing the burr grinders are better.

I guess I'm here to say, I'm not sure how far to plunge. The common advised starting points are $120+ unless I go with a good manual grinder which is still $100+ it seems. On the one hand I can afford that if I really choose to, but I feel like getting a $130 grinder to grind my 6 month old bags of coffee grounds to dump into my $45 coffee maker isnt doing it justice, and I'm not sure when or if I would get a better coffee maker/french press/espresso machine to make full use of a grinder with so many options. Or get higher quality beans on a weekly basis so theyre always truly fresh. 

How far did you guys go when you started upgrading? Did you go all in with grinder/coffee maker/coffee at once, or did you upgrade one at a time, or did you get budget options for all and then higher quality options over years? It's just overwhelming picturing it all as someone who ultimately just wants better cups of coffee over the work day.",1643225706,huc3j22,Coffee,2022-01-26T19:35:06Z

"Because if people are staying home and dining rooms are closed, what's the point of Starbucks?

Their entire business model relies off of people who are picking up coffee on their way to work (or wherever they're going) and people buying coffee while sitting at their tables to study, or have a meeting. When people are working from home and barely leaving the house, they don't need Starbucks, because most likely they have a coffee maker at home.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

A superhero gets into an argument at a convenience store with the cashier. Chaos ensues.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

‚ÄúYou take that back, bitch boy.‚Äù

*‚ÄùNo.‚Äù*

Both ‚Äúadults‚Äù blow raspberries at each other with increasing voracity, until one finally snaps. Nobody knows who threw the first berry, but it heats up into an all out brawl.

Ranboo decides to chuck a blueberry straight to Tommy‚Äôs suit. Tommy finds a fistful of strawberries in the far-back aisle. With all his strength, he chucks the strawberry container at him; not those tiny plastic boxes, the entire wooden cart, chewing on the fistful with anger laced in his veins. He would win the war, with every strawberry he could squeeze from this place.

Ranboo takes cover in aisle 1, letting the coffee maker take the brunt of the hits. *Pow, pow, pow!* The red sea of berries splatter across the counter, dripping down the sides. His black and white mask is covered in a red, murderous paste.

Ranboo bombs him with coffee beans as Tommy ducks to avoid it, before Ranboo loads up on blueberries and charges him down. Fistfuls of smears of blue, Ranboo smuttering his matted hair, laughing. He didn‚Äôt give up though, even on the bottom he is able to mess up Ranboo‚Äôs shirt to hell and back.

In the end, both are drenched in a flurry of blues and red, some by their very own hands out of happenstance. Their bodies entangled in a brawl that started with blowing raspberries and ending in war. The doorbell rings and it sounds like silence grating against Tommy‚Äôs ears. Tommy grips one of the shelves, peering down to the doorway. He notices underneath the raspberries, he couldn‚Äôt even see the wound reopening from all the movements and fruits. He certainly feels it though, warmth pooling on his skin.

Ranboo freezes up, the wind shivering against both their arms; it tastes of death. Tommy twists his head further, and his eyes lock onto a green and white bucket hat shifting towards them. Ropy wings with flowing black feathers pillar behind the person. The wings could only be described as armor shielding their whole back, trailing across the ground like his personal shadow.

‚ÄúPhil-? P-Phil!‚Äù

The pitter patter of his shoes stop two feet from them, replaced with a drop.

A fruit basket misses his head. He imagines the basket screaming at the mashed horrors of their fallen siblings.

Fear strikes not only the fruit but Tommy‚Äôs heart. Something primal, wild, kept forcing his lungs to keep producing one breath after another when he wanted to collapse.

‚ÄúWhy are you here?‚Äù His head gives a deadly pound as he‚Äôs sent into more confusion. *He doesn‚Äôt know this man*, yet it's like he‚Äôs seen him a thousand times.

The man‚Äôs wide eyes spring to life, and Tommy can‚Äôt tell what that means. Meanwhile, Ranboo‚Äôs heart is flipping 360s in pure terror as he tries to explain, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not what it looks like!‚Äù

Tommy doesn‚Äôt care what it looks like at this point; his arm really hurts, and why didn‚Äôt he get it checked out before? It probably is as nasty as it feels, and Tubbo will yell at him for being injured, but Tommy doesn‚Äôt really care.
Tommy is tired.

‚ÄúLook, Phil- Tommy that‚Äôs my boss- and I can explain-‚Äú

The words go unheard as Phil tilts his head down at him.

What an ignorant fuck just gawking at him like he just popped a squat on his lawn. ‚ÄúWhat are you staring at, old man? I look familiar or something to you, innit?‚Äù

His eyes drew like curtains, the black feathers lulling him like sheep.

However, this past Christmas I had lots of family staying over, who all drank coffee.

Kitchen - my coffee maker is next to my sink in the kitchen for ease of filling, mugs above it, coffee bags on a shelf, kettle incase I want tea next to it, and my fridge is in arms reach for my milk. Don't have to move a step. 

Washer - laundry detergent and softer sits ontop, and a fold down washing basket is hung off the side of the washing machine. 

En suite shower room- below my sink I have my skin care, my face wash, spares for the shower (which is one step away). In a cabinet behind the mirror are brushes and hair ties. So I can do my whole routine there without moving. I even have a little telescopic stool if I want to sit infront of the sink. 

Lounge - most of my craft stuff is next to where I sit to relax, so I have lots to prompt me if I get bored of procrastination and actually want to do something with my time. 

Toilet - all the health and tooth are related items are right next to my sink, so just washing my hands after using the toilet when I get up prompts me and means my teeth are more likely to get cleaned (and a purposefully separate room to the makeup and hair because that is too many distractions!)

"While I agree the issues in other areas isn‚Äôt nearly as big. Right to repair isnt needed to repair your own axe when you break the handle off. 

The issues are mainly with consumer electronics, appliances and cars. (And in  a professional setting the extreme repair fees on essential equipment) 

The big issue is that some parts that are needed are just not sold, usually not sold to consumers but sometimes not sold at all. 

When the pump on a washing machine or the button on a coffee maker fails you would expect that it‚Äôs a part that can fail and you can order and replace. For the most part this is possible. There still are issues when it comes to plastic parts and certain things so I really hope these are included 

With electronics however it‚Äôs a whole different deal. Apple‚Äôs iPhone charging chip is a famous example but far from the only one. It‚Äôs a custom chips only they use and it is impossible to buy from the 3rd party manufacturer that makes the chips for apple. 
So when that chip dies instead of paying 10$ for a chip (they cost cents to make, biggest cost is shipping and handling) and 50$ to a professional to solder it to your phone you are stuck buying a new phone for 10-20 times what it would cost you. And instead of Apple making a 2$ on the chip and having you keep using your old phone 2 years longer they get to sell you a new phone sooner. Making them a few 100$ more. 

Because people started to take parts out of the mountain of old phones that are around to fix theirs Apple even started to make easy to swap components like the camera, battery etc communicate to the motherboard if it was the original part from the phone. So even if you had the right part you would still need an Apple technician to connect it so some software to give the go ahead on the repair.

Similar to what some ‚Äúhigh end‚Äù car manufacturers are doing nowadays. 

That sort of predatory practices are just not right and I am glad to see legislation is being passed that is going ‚Äúthis has gone too far, time to curb the waste that is planned obsolescence and make sure devices can be fixed if the customer wants to.‚Äù",1643195064,hua3dz8,gadgets,2022-01-26T11:04:24Z

If you don't see his car in the parking lot or the lights on downstairs don't wait in line with the others. Want to call ahead to see if he is open? No phone. What are the prices?  Who knows, prices aren't posted but they are cheap and he could charge a lot more.  Rose his ""employee"" doesn't know the prices either.  She asks after every time she fills an order.  She can't see anything on the top row either so she is blindly stabbing around until she hits paydirt. Is Rose new? No shes a mainstay.  She is part of the charm.  She's the comedic relief. If she was replaced with someone who was a mediocre there probably wouldn't be a line and they would be sold out in an hour instead of two. Is there a sign for Better Maid? Nope. Donuts used to be painted on the side of the building.  Then a car went through it and it didn't get repainted with the repair.  There is a sidewalk sign that he puts out some days.  If the line is already going it says inside. Can you get coffee with your donut?  There is a Mr Coffee maker in the corner.  Does he charge for it? Is it a make your own situation? Who knows (certainly not Rose).  This goes back to the no prices posted anywhere.  I've seen drinks like chocolate milk in the cooler before but I feel like I haven't seen anything in the past year.  I love this place, best donuts around, but throw any idea of how you expect a business to run out the window.",1643170004,hu929tc,pittsburgh,2022-01-26T04:06:44Z

"In my opinion, coffee.

My girlfriend would spend like $3 daily on coffee that was just milk and sugar. I'm like I have milk, sugar, homemade caramel and homemade cinnamon whipped cream at home, why are you paying 20x as much for a lower quality coffee!!!! Our coffee maker has a timer setting, it could be ready when you wake up and it's way faster than going to the coffee shop. You just have to do the extremely laborious task of gping in the fridge and stirring in the ingredients.

It is so fuckin easy to make coffee for yourself that costs pennies. I can see if it's a one time purchase. But if you're buying basic coffees daily you might as well use singles to wipe your ass as it would be less costly.",1643164182,hu8p2m6,AskReddit,2022-01-26T02:29:42Z

First, don't tell anybody...then you'll have a three pill buffer for the next five months! Second, see if you can reschedule psych for another month out. Don't cite a reason other than your schedule is conflicting. Then you gotta be DILIGENT this month, so you come armed to your appt with actual useful info.

7 day pill container. Put it next to your toothbrush or coffee maker or your glasses on the nightstand, wherever you always for sure go in the morning. Keep a bottle of water next to them. If at night you ever see them and think ooo it would be satisfying to refill that, DO IT THEN. You don't have to wait til Sunday. Let impulse work for you, not against. 

Keep a record of if/when you notice the meds are and aren't helping. It doesn't have to be perfect or complete. I like to send myself messages on Messenger because it automatically adds a time and date stamp.

"It depends on the price of the coffee too and how often you go, but most people are spending in the $7-10 per cup at Starbucks. There is 8% sales tax on all prepared foods in my area. Prices are pretty high in my area. Its not just coffee either, they are getting other things too. If you added all this up it comes out to a lot of money especially if you do this every day, not to mention the time and gas wasted in the drive thru.   
I know a couple people who would go twice to Starbucks, once in the morning once in the afternoon.

If you invest in a coffee maker that will last a few years and buy your coffee its significantly cheaper and time saving to make your own cup at home. Buy a starbucks cup and put your coffee in that if you must. You can make coffee for pennies a cup this way.

Some people do this in combination with ordering doordash for lunch or dinner. I am not going to go there, those orders are over $20 each for..... something like a hamburger.",1643152225,hu7wd1k,AskReddit,2022-01-25T23:10:25Z
"I went to college in La Crosse WI, with some of the hardest tap water I‚Äôve ever experienced (clogged a brand new coffee maker within a couple of weeks) so I got used to using a filter jug.

"I can‚Äôt relate to the fear of specifically rodents, I find them all precious (even NYC rats üòÖ), and I even have 2 pet rats of my own. However, I can relate on a debilitating level to having general creepy-crawlies in the home. Specifically, any species of bug. I start sobbing whenever a moth the size of my pinky nail gets into the house. I‚Äôm even scared of butterflies! Their wings are pretty from far away, but up close their bodies are so disgusting. Interestingly enough, we happen to live in the woods! With‚Ä¶. wood roaches!!

I‚Äôm not a mom, I‚Äôm just a teenager who was browsing through subreddits, and I live with 3 other people. But somehow, every *single* time there is a roach in the house, I have to be the one to find it! There was one time I was washing dishes, and my parents put Titanic on the TV. I hadn‚Äôt seen it in a while so I was taking breaks to watch the movie. I took a towel, the very
towel I had been using to dry my hands the whole time, and used it to brush my neck. Immediately after, for just a moment, I felt something on the hollow of my throat that didn‚Äôt feel like my shirt or the towel. I brush my hands against it, and nothing is there, I guess. Until approximately 4 seconds later, a giant ass *roach* scurries it‚Äôs way out from behind the fruit stand and goes behind the coffee maker. Instantaneous reaction. Immediately, I‚Äôm sobbing and shrieking and my parents are like ‚ÄúWTF????‚Äù, until I tell them what happened. The rest of the night was fine, they finished the dishes and made hot chocolate. But nevertheless, this is not the only time I have been contaminated by the wretched beasts.

I was home alone one night, as my mom was on a girls trip of sorts, my sister was at her job, and my dad was working late. I take a hazard into the garage, despite us living in a southern state where the only time it gets cold is like, a singular week in January. I knew the little shits were a risk, as I had seen them many a time before while greeting my dad in the garage. But I am able to brave the wilderness of a slightly larger than standard block of concrete, and make it to the freezer without a hitch. I unlock the freezer, and I‚Äôm digging around the frozen meat for the good stuff, when I realize‚Ä¶ the floor under my big toe is‚Ä¶ soft? My blood feels like ice, my heart pounding so hard I can feel my pulse hammering against my skull. I hesitantly look down, and there it is. A live roach, upside down, under my big toe, wiggling it‚Äôs spindly little legs in a pathetic attempt to escape. I hold it together for long enough to close the freezer, but not lock it, and walk back to the door without running for my life, but as soon as I close it behind me all bets are off. Going from 0-100 in a single second, I call my dad blubbering incoherently, and he sounds frustrated with my weeping. I manage to choke out how *a roach touched me* and, once again, I was met with much empathy. Both stories are funny to look back on, but this happened in early November and I still haven‚Äôt entered the garage past dark.

Anyways, this was all a very long-winded way of saying I understand your pain!! Although, interestingly enough, I‚Äôm not scared of spiders. Just perfectly rational insects, like ladybugs.",1643151455,hu7uf1b,Mommit,2022-01-25T22:57:35Z

"This is a problem, OP. Pizza all weekend is also a problem. This is just lazy as well as bad nutrition.  

Get a crockpot and a rice cooker. You can make crockpot chicken or beef and serve it over rice with very little effort. It will make enough to cover several meals. Not great, but better than pizza or fast food. 

Vegetables, please. Three bites before he gives up. Try a variety or ask your ex what his favorites are. 

One soda per day. Let him decide when he wants it, and stick to it through the whining. It will help teach him to self regulate, which is very important throughout your lifetime.  For the rest of the time, try sugar free powder drink mixes. They're easy and one pitcher will last at least a day. Or buy an iced tea maker. 4 or 5 tea bags in the top.

"Really depends on the family dynamic. Are they ‚Äúguests‚Äù that you need to host? Or are they ‚Äúfamily‚Äù that‚Äôll help &amp; clean up after themselves? There‚Äôs a big difference between the two. If my mom cones, I can put the clean sheets in the guest room &amp; she‚Äôll make the bed herself. She‚Äôll cook me breakfast (she doesn‚Äôt eat breakfast, so it‚Äôs just for me), do laundry, clean, etc. my IL‚Äôs kinda sit around &amp; wait for me to feed them. Now that we have toddlers, it‚Äôs fine because they‚Äôll play with their grandkids while I make dinner. But there‚Äôs **no way** I could host my IL‚Äôs with a newborn fresh out of the hospital that has their nights &amp; days mixed up, is having trouble latching during breastfeeding, &amp; only doing contact sleeping. I would end up sitting in the nursery breastfeeding all day (baby ate every 2-3 hours &amp; each feeding was about 45 minutes) because I couldn‚Äôt use a cover (latch issues) &amp; wasn‚Äôt comfortable nursing in front of my IL‚Äôs. And they would end up sitting on my couch watching TV by themselves all day. And not to mention my own recovery-the bleeding &amp; pain. If you only have one bathroom you are going to monopolize it (in case of vaginal delivery). 

Honestly, I‚Äôd ask your doctor about postpartum recovery, read up about the 4th trimester, &amp; both you &amp; your husband need to learn about newborn care. Plus, what if baby comes a week late? Or if there‚Äôs an extended hospital stay? Your IL‚Äôs could miss seeing baby entirely if their departure date isn‚Äôt flexible.

If you still decide to host your IL‚Äôs, have your husband set the tone by giving them a ‚Äútour‚Äù when they arrive. Show them where the garbage bags are, where the Clorox wipes are kept (just to wipe crumbs off counters), &amp; where things are, e.g., dish soap, dish cloths, TP, paper towels, &amp; clean linen. Show them where the toaster is &amp; where breakfast stuff is kept so they can help themselves.

You shouldn‚Äôt expect them to deep-clean the place but it‚Äôs a perfectly reasonable expectation that they‚Äôre able to make themselves a sandwich or to heat up a can of soup (&amp; for them to clean up after themselves) instead of waiting around for you or your husband to do it for them.",1643116974,hu5e6b7,beyondthebump,2022-01-25T13:22:54Z

I recommend adding puzzles, frozen treats (I freeze a mushed banana in a west paw toppl), and chew toys to your routine. This gives you a moment to yourself and is tiring/fun for puppies. In my experience this activity works well as an interrupter for zoomies. 

My puppy is very food motivated so at the beginning she was more receptive to training before breakfast. Try changing the moment you train, maybe your puppy will be more engaged.

Our predecessors never had to face a global pandemic.

No one cares, but: I chaired the CT Region through the pandemic. Becoming virtual. Group conscience and autonomy vs. what affects NA as a whole. Unity.

I found myself angry at groups (and more often single members with the loudest voices) that demanded we stay open during the shutdowns because addicts were dying. Times were precarious.

"GE Caf√© - Smart Drip, but I think the Oxo is better value and much cheaper. My coworker's wife does product reviews and she tested a handful of machines, the GE Cafe was their 2nd favorite and the Oxo was their #1. They gave me this one. If mine broke, I would buy the newest version of the same product.

I have an older version of this one: https://www.cafeappliances.com/appliance/Cafe-Specialty-Drip-Coffee-Maker-with-Glass-Carafe-C7CDABS2RS3 (the matte black looks real nice, imo)

The only issue I have with it is that when I left the lid, the condensation rolls towards the hinge and can drip onto my counter top. So it makes a very little mess. One could accidentally wipe the hot plate trying to clean up. I solve this by tapping the lid, or lifting it an inch and then dropping it a few times to shake off the biggest water droplets. I also have a kitchen rag next to the machine.

You don't need to use paper filters, but I do because it makes the clean up a lot easier. There is a special way to fold the edges of the #4 coffee (V shape cone) to make it fit better in the metal filter.

https://www.huffpost.com/entry/coffee-filter-doesnt-fit-right-coffee-maker_n_56d09785e4b0871f60eb402d

It comes with a pretty usable(but shitty) app where I can set the alarm to brew, the temperature between 190 and 205 degrees, the brew strength, and number of cups. I haven't worked out the brew strength, but I usually just use ""Gold"" for everything. There are 4 of the, low, medium, high, and gold.

It keeps the pot hot for 2 hours after brewing.

If you do not have the pot in the machine, it will disable it from brewing. Also, if you brew more cups than it has water, it'll just make some audible alarm but the machine is fine.

I'm happy with it, I usually brew 4-6 cups for myself.

Initially I just wanted to know if the lower priced lithium battery can meet my requirements, the answer is Yes, with a 2000w inverter and 400w solar panel, this 100AH battery could support my laptop and cellphone all day without any problems, actually I also use it to drive my coffee maker 1500w, great product!

"Instant coffee is what that sounds like. Instant coffee is also pretty low on the quality tier. 

You have 2 easy options and 1 not-so-easy option. 

Option 1: Get a cold brew coffee maker. Very simple, very low effort. There's usually a glass jar with something that goes in that holds coffee grounds. Fill it with coffee grounds and then water. Let it sit in your fridge between 12-24 hours depending on how strong you want it. When it's done, toss the grounds out. Now you have cold brew coffee, or nuke it for hot coffee. Coffee made this way has more flavor and is stronger. 

Option 2: get a coffee maker. Get some coffee filters. Fill coffee maker with water. Fill coffee maker with grounds in the filter paper. Brew. 

Option 3: Grind your own coffee then use option 1 or 2. No real pros to this other than being that dude who grinds his own coffee.

"Before I went NC, whenever they visited they would invariably break something in my house, but it was never their fault.

No one in my household drinks coffee. We bought an inexpensive coffee maker just for them to use when visiting because they always gave us so much grief for not having a coffee maker.

Instead of apologizing, they blamed the coffee maker because their coffee maker at home had a red light to indicate that it‚Äôs still turned on.

Another time they broke my garbage disposal because they threw a banana peel in it. Instead of apologizing, they kept reiterating that their disposal at home can chop up banana peels.

I think it's supposed to be grating, you're supposed to roll your eyes at the narrator a bit while maybe sympathizing with the feeling of being unreasonable annoyed by some small things.

"**Some questions that would be helpful to answer:** 

* How many fencers do you have?  
* Are you the only coach? 
* What weapons?

**Must Haves** *(take note of how many of them are not ""fencing"" specific at all, you're running a small business now)*:

* An electronic scheduling and POS system. To manage your clients and bill them. There are none designed *specifically* for fencing clubs but, there are some designed for other sorts of gyms that work fine - such as Pike13. These programs can process credit cards too so you can probably get by without a stand alone credit card processor - like square - while you're small enough.
* Professional insurance - protect yourself and anyone who works for you (paid or not)
* USA Fencing club membership - for the insurance (even if it's redundant).
* A professional website - fencing is a niche sport. You need to assume that most of your clients will have never heard of fencing until you tell them about it (via marketing). 
* An active facebook/Instagram account - same as above
* An internet connection - for lots of reasons: updating fencing time membership lists, for waiting parents, for processes sing credit cards and scheduling, etc...
* A listed phone number - that could be your personal mobile number or it could be a *Google Voice* number that routes to a phone.
* Floating wood floors are a must. You cannot expect to have people pay you to practice at your club and then trash their knees on a linoleum or concrete floor. You can make them yourself by screwing plywood sheets to a wide grid of 2x4's which can lay on the ground. This creates a little ""bounciness"" in the floor that saves knees.
* At 3k square feet you're pretty small... maybe you can fit 3-4 strips in. If you're an epee club then at least half of those need to be grounded. You can use perforated 3ft by 6ft steel sheets and screw them down to make effective electric strips. (When my current club was only at 8k feet we had 9 strips.)
* You need boxes and reels (or a bungee system) for every strip you have (no dry-only strips).
* At least 40 jackets, masks, weapons, and gloves in various sizes - especially small - to use as loaner/rental gear for beginner classes. Vendors can advise you on the sizes you might need.
* \~ 25 complete practice weapons in the weapon you will be coaching beginner classes in.
* *Lot's* of cleaning supplies - you are now responsible for floors and bathrooms. Not to mention bleach wiping loaner masks. 
* A club account with a fencing equipment vendor because you can get kickbacks and discounts from them.
* Drinking fountains, water cooler, or bottled water for sale (children can't be expected to always remember)
* At least 1-2 sets of armoury tools.
* A coffee maker - you work in this place afterall.

**The nice to haves**:

* a small armoury nook for *you (and any staff)*
* Stacked washer and dryer (for cleaning club kits)
* basic apparel (t-shirts, warm-ups, and patches)
* FIE Boxes on strips that could be used for local comps.
* a small supply of loaner electric weapons (make people buy their own but just in case).
* exercise bikes, rowing machines, treadmills, etc... If you can fit them, your space is already pretty tight it sounds
* Parent seating area.

**Straight up luxuries:**

* On site fencing equipment for sale.
* Vending machines
* extended lines of apparel
* A wet bar (only *very slightly* sarcastic).

**Things that** ***sound*** **great that aren't actually:**

* Lockers and gear storage - members love this coaches/staff hate it. If a members gear is at the club then it's not at home getting washed - it'll stink and it'll become your problem. And, inevitable someone will need to get to their gear off hours too. It's just annoying.
* Public changing areas - lawsuits waiting to happen. Tell them to use the private stalls in the bathroom.",1643051926,hu21xo6,Fencing,2022-01-24T19:18:46Z

"A 15 amp breaker is good for about 1.8 kW, or 1800 W (15A \* 120V). That coffee maker is probably 600 - 1000 W, the microwave is 1000 - 1200 W, all the lights (pure guess here) is 80 - 200 W. You seem to have about 3500 W of stuff on that breaker, which is fine as long as they are not on at the same time. 

Ideally, the microwave would be on 1 circuit, the living room on a separate circuit, the bathroom on a separate circuit (especially with the heater), and the kitchen on a separate circuit. With the kitchen on its own circuit, you could have 2-3 small appliances on at a time (such as coffee pot, toaster, blender).

"Thank you all who have commented. I'm going to try and respond to as many of you as I can.

My husband suffers from untreated anxiety and depression (to explain further what prompted this). I give him constant grace, but I'm tired of it. We've been working on the same issues for years. He finally relented this morning to calling our therapist and asking for individual sessions because he started spiraling again. It started over me not being nice enough this morning. I'm sorry, before coffee, I can barely do more than grunt. I asked him if he unplugged my coffee maker (it's unplugged every morning, and he charges his phone there), and he was like, what's the big deal if he did. Well, it resets it, so could you please try to be more aware and plug it back in when you do. It's an unseen thing that upset me. Breakdown triggered. I don't thank him for getting our toddler ready in the morning and making the kids' freezer waffles. Fine, you're right. I should be more grateful that you parent your children. 

I get that I'm a SAHM working on writing a novel and doing other work on the side, but seeing as how that doesn't financially contribute, he has it ten times worse. No matter how supportive I am of his job or telling him I appreciate him, it's never enough. Even though what I do is equally demanding, but in a different way. Our therapist cannot stress this enough. He knows it, but he doesn't see it. He probably never will unless I somehow write the next bestseller and nab a TV series deal. Here's hoping.

So as I said, I see you. I know how thin you're stretched. I know you cry in the shower because I do too. And though I love him, I just want him to see me. And fucking thank me for buying his damn deodorant and body wash.",1643039134,hu13pcb,breakingmom,2022-01-24T15:45:34Z
"Just because strange things happen doesn't necessarily make them paranormal, im not saying you don't already know this but let me explain: 

A house I used to live in also had a history of strange events but for a long while I paid no attention to it. Then years later after having been in psychic training for over a year or so I was watching TV in the living room and the coffee maker turned on by itself by starting the grinding mill. There were no coffee beans in the mill nor water so there was no reason for it to be active. I thought this was paranormal activity as an entity was trying to get in touch for me. Given the home was already haunted once so it also further suggests paranormal activity.

However later I found out through a friend who is also psychic that she had the same coffee maker both brand and model, but she told me she tossed it out because it was running on its own and the company later announced it had a defect which caused them to start on their own.

My point is this: just because it appears haunted does not mean that it is, in fact most of the time its not and there is a rational explanation, but I can understand the rush to claim its paranormal. The chances are this tablet is defective or just bugged, the company that makes the tablet will send an update to fix it if that is the case. 

So anyways, keep an eye on it and if it keeps happening, ask the company that makes the tablet if there have been bugs or defects. Remember, only when all possible explanations have been exhausted is it time to consider the possibility of paranormal activity.",1643038918,hu135sj,Ghosts,2022-01-24T15:41:58Z

"&gt; What makes disorder a disorder (among a few other things) is distress. Despite having the emotional range of a coffee maker, struggling with keeping memories even about most important events, having wonky sense of self, being unable to do the simplest self-maintenance tasks at times and judging my interest in people by whether or not they make me wanna grab a pen and stab myself in the eye, I'm not in subjective distress. 

Here's the catch-22: to use an analogy, damped emotional signals are like being anesthesized at the dentist's. One doesn't feel the pain anymore, but that doesn't mean everything is immediately alright. The tooth needs to be fixed, still.  
  
Numbness / apathy / dissociation / depersonalization don't have to be interpreted as _active distress_, yet they can indicate impoverishment of subjective experiences and stuck energy in the body. Being ""stuck in flight / fight"" can manifest as active distress, but being ""stuck in freeze"" manifests differently, so different criteria of imbalance are necessary. **Damped signals of imbalance are not quite the same thing as balance.** (you mentioned some examples)  
  
&gt; someone may have more emotions, more connections and more meaning in their life, but it may still leave them unsatisfied and longing, feeling unadjusted and impaired.  
  
""More"" is not the same as ""balanced""  
  
* Too little = a void  
* Too much = overwhelming / stressful  
* Balanced = just the right amount (nourishing)",1643035094,hu0tzuc,Schizoid,2022-01-24T14:38:14Z

Sometimes I'm really thinking if I should get help or if there's even help for caffeine addiction. I'm not sure if I should be proud that out of the vices I've had (drinking, smoking, smoking weed) coffee is the only one that stuck.",1643026715,hu0e0tr,AskReddit,2022-01-24T12:18:35Z

"Thats definitely a big problem. The heater, or microwave or coffee maker should really each have their own dedicated breaker as they all are near the 15A on their own.

"I don‚Äôt think there is a right or wrong answer here. I don‚Äôt prioritize it and I have zero regrets. However I know some people that do. I also know some people that wish they didn‚Äôt spend the money on photography or other thing and spent it on food or other things non-wedding related. 

For me it just was not important. Not at all. I will never be the person whose house you walk into and you see tons photos hanging up. Then again I hate anything that resembles clutter. I am also the person that you will come over and every thing has a space or home. If something comes into the house something more than likely comes. I have a storage container full of photos. The last time I looked at those photos was when I put them in there.  I have nothing on my kitchen counters. Not even a ute sim jar. I have a cabinet to hide the coffee maker.   I also don‚Äôt post my life to social media.
However... I am more than you look are beautiful and will amazing on your day. Never made a social media or engagement announcement. And luckily I‚Äôm with someone who hate social media just as much. I work in PR I deal with social life media often, don‚Äôt want to deal with it in my non work life too. I also don‚Äôt have a single photo of my on my phone. I just don‚Äôt take photos. 

Also I had to have two different receptions. Having one was not an option. So we had to cut costs. As it would have been  my family or his family. But logistics we couldn‚Äôt have one with both. So that was another reason we cut it. And food was most important to me. Over photography, dj (didn‚Äôt have one), and decor. I only care about food. 

However even saying all of that there are lots of reasons to have .. and lots of reasons not too. As you can see it made complete sense for me. However I‚Äôm sure you are beautiful l. And I know you will looking amazing on your wedding day. There are plenty of reason not to have one. As you could tell by mine above. There are also plenty of reasons to have one. However even though I didn‚Äôt.. I would hate for you to regret having one bc you don‚Äôt think you are pretty enough. I know you are. And please really think about why you don‚Äôt want one. And if it is bc you would rather have a lot of candid photos. That is absolutely okay. If you would rather spend the money or risk doing something also. Just don‚Äôt let it be bc of that insecurity. Which I‚Äôm also well aware is easier said than down.  xo

"This sounds a lot like my abusive ex so I‚Äôm not gonna pull punches because I don‚Äôt know you but I‚Äôm one of those ‚ÄúI love all people until I‚Äôm given a reason not to‚Äù so I love you, OP, and I want the best for you.

First and foremost: this is rape. Every single time you don‚Äôt want to have sex with him so you just ‚Äúgive in‚Äù and do it so he ‚Äúisn‚Äôt mad‚Äù‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs rape. Every time you‚Äôre in pain and he doesn‚Äôt stop, it‚Äôs rape. There‚Äôs no 2 ways about it. Regardless of your kink (I‚Äôll get into that later) if you or your body are saying ‚Äúno‚Äù and he is doing it anyway‚Ä¶.well, I‚Äôm not going to say it again.

Second - your marriage isn‚Äôt great. How you‚Äôre treated is a huge part of your marriage and you‚Äôre being treated poorly. I would imagine whether or not you want to admit it that you walk on eggshells a lot - probably over little things. Things that you think don‚Äôt matter. Like it he wanted his coffee on at 730a and you don‚Äôt do it until 735a but when he gets out of the shower, if he asked you‚Äôd still say it was on at 730a‚Ä¶.and probably blame the coffee maker for being old and taking longer than normal. I would imagine you cover for him - a lot - while simultaneously praising him (‚ÄúOh no sorry he couldn‚Äôt make it today - he works so hard and he needed to XYZ but he wishes you well!‚Äù while he probably just didn‚Äôt want to come and is sitting home playing video games or whatever).

Lastly - any person who doesn‚Äôt want to help with their children regardless of ‚Äútheir job‚Äù is a bad parent. And a good parent (you) shouldn‚Äôt have to pick up the slack for a bad parent (him). You work a full time job too and are STILL awake when your sick kids - what the actual fuck is his excuse? If he can‚Äôt care for his literal flesh and blood then of course he isn‚Äôt going to care for you.

As far as the consensual rape kink goes? As a Dom I will punch your husband square in the jaw if he ever - EVER - decides to use that as an excuse for literally raping you. I can see your speculation about it, but it‚Äôs just more proof of him not really giving a crap about you. Someone who cared would do a little goddamn research about it to immediately know that, no, it doesn‚Äôt mean do whatever you want whenever you want you pompous buffoon (him, the buffoon - not you).

I‚Äôm not gonna sit here and tell you to get a divorce but I am going to plead with you to go to therapy with him. If you don‚Äôt work this out it‚Äôs going to bubble over and bleed into your life so much more than it already has. I used to put water into rubber glove fingers and freeze them and literally stick them in my vagina for my 3 mile walk to work after my ex would choose of their own accord to fuck me WHILE I was saying no. So much blood, so many bruises. I shit my brains out for hours now if I swallow semen because my ex would rape me and then forcefully shove my mouth on their dick and make me swallow, which has caused a lot of mental anguish that has morphed into actual physical issues.

I promise you sex is fun. I promise you that when you‚Äôre with the right person not only will it not be PAINFUL where you need a bath afterwards but when you say ‚Äúno‚Äù it‚Äôs respected.

Plus a lot of what your husband is saying feels like projection, like he‚Äôs trying to fuck you all the time so you don‚Äôt ask why HE isn‚Äôt fucking you. And then he‚Äôs claiming you‚Äôre not attracted to him or are cheating on him before you can realize those are, in fact, his own thoughts and feelings right now.

My grandparents just got a new coffee maker and it's a bit fancier than the other one they used to have. When I see it and mention how nice it is, they tell me not to touch it and that they'll teach me how to use it. Mind you, I build and fix computers for a living and help them with every tiny thing electronic wise even down to downloading an app on their phone and how to answer a call on my grandfather's new phone. I get upset and start to say something, and I'm immediately cut off by both my grandparents and my parents with the ""it's not yours"" card, when I'm fully capable of pressing 2 buttons to brew a damn cup of coffee. We have a shouting match and I just walk to the extra room to cool off while they sit in the living room and talk about how disrespectful I am and to throw my computer in the trash.

"I think a couple guys felt the same way some 200 some years ago. They left that Godforsaken place and started a new one. Unfortunately, the money and the power that brought them here is now what has taken over yet again. 

The difference is, our forefathers truly loved freedom, so much that they were willing to die for it. In this day and age the general population loves comfort, stability, and believing blindly because it‚Äôs easier than thinking for oneself.

The money that took over our country did so by monopolizing. Corporations run the world, not the people. So many have plugged themselves into the machine, and are immune to that little voice that beckons from beyond gray cubicle walls ‚Äúthere‚Äôs more to life than this.‚Äù

The answer is simple. You kill a beast by removing its head. If every cog in every corporate machine was removed, it would be rendered useless. They trick you to believe you‚Äôre easily replaceable, and singularly we are, however we are not ALL replaceable. 

If every American (I‚Äôm assuming your talking about the US) decided tomorrow they were done, and quit working for corporations, the empire would crumble before us. Think about it. No drivers, no receptionists, no one to make the coffee, fix the unplugged cables and clean up the mess. If they figured out how to get there, and how to open the door for themselves, the elite would still waste half the day trying to find the coffee filters and cups in the office.

"I think **you described something very important**. If we don't know how something feels, or **can't even imagine it**, that may be one of the strongest barriers to achieving it. (I have one of these too.) 

Being fed up with something can be a strong driver of actual, long-lasting change, and **finding what we REALLY want**.  - Because we're sure as hell it's not THAT. :D  
So being fed up is not all bad either. It can be a force that makes you ""keep on keeping on"" on a boring day at work, when you're tired but gotta do chores, etc.   
Use it if you can.

**I suggest you make a plan. Or a draft of a plan.**  
Have partial, definite things as goals. Focus on down-to-earth, 3D stuff at first as **steps towards those goal(s)**. Writing them down helps too. If you have a long list, select the 3-5 most important ones and put them first. **Visualize individual parts of it.** These parts can then get together into larger and more complex scenarios with time. 

You might not know how it feels to be rich, but before that, you can try out how it feels when you're not constantly watching price tags while shopping. Or getting a decent salary that makes you not worry about rent every month. Work towards those first, **set up a foundation**, **and routines** you feel secure about, and can be upheld no matter if it rains or shines. This also applies to social life.

At least, this is how I started from a similar situation, and now it bears fruits I never could've imagined 5 years ago. (Not rich, but without struggle. Not super-successful, but compared to the starting point, it's impressive.)

**I advise to focus on these basics**:

1. **WORK**   
\- **Find a job.** Write a CV. Apply to job listings every day. Listen to critique, or ask someone to take a look at it if it's not getting responses. Or just LUCK OUT and find THAT ONE listing on facebook that immediately clicks with you. :) Gut feelings and visualization can help in this.  
\- **Then bust your ass off.** Focus on your work, or current goal / activity. Look for ways you can get better at it. Educate yourself in areas that interest you. If you haven't got interests, look for them. Immerse yourself in this new life you're creating.   
\- **Save up every month.** Plant new ""seeds"" for the future. Prepare for bigger goals.

(I know, I know, **this sounds banal**, but it's not. Sometimes we gotta set goals that are **guaranteed** to deliver us to the further steps we want to reach. This is one such step. Not everyone can become a millionaire Instagram star or win a house, or some such overnight. If it happens, good.   
If it doesn't, then good ol' honest work and specialized knowledge can be the stepping stone to gain momentum. Also, have you heard of those lottery winners who were worse off some time after they won, than they were before? Because they didn't have anything to stop them from falling back to where they were. They haven't ""built it up"".)

2. **HOME**  
\- **Rent an apartment.** Manage moving all your stuff there. Throw out or give away things you no longer need. Make room for new things. (Try picturing yourself living there while you're viewing the apartment.)  
\- **Make it feel like home.** (You are left alone, nobody can hurt you here. You can hang your favourite pictures on the walls, sing under the shower, invite people over anytime, ignore those who you don't want there, etc.)

\---------------------------------

**Now this might be an important divider, as** **having a decent HOME and a decent salary / income** **for the first time** **can be a HUGE thing in itself. It frees you from suffering.**

As someone who didn't have it, could not have imagined it until it happened. And it got in the way of having any other goals and successes. I'm not saying this is the only way, but I know it works for sure.

\---------------------------------

**When reaching this divider, life may not be PERFECT, but it's good enough to live with, and is a solid ground to further your options and imagination.**   
\- buy some things you always wanted, but could never have or afford before (like a decent shoe, a coffee maker, a better PC, etc.)  
\- meet new people, find those who you can express yourself with  
\- learn new things, figure out what you like to do, work on your expertise, etc.  
\- try out some hobbies, travel to places, broaden your horizon

There will come a certain stage, when you'll feel that you are THERE. When these partial, small things come together, and make a whole. Life ceases to be a chore. It eases into a rhythm that you'll actually be comfortable with.

It may take a lot of patience and perseverance until you build up this platform you can ""jump off of"", and ENJOY life. But **it will inevitably happen if you keep at it**. And this way, you can be sure as hell **you're not going to fall back down from a temporary high either**. :)

Sorry it got this long. Did it help you have some ideas? Or have you tried some of it before?  
If so, I'd be glad to hear it.

Godspeed and good luck!",1642974737,htxnfug,NevilleGoddard,2022-01-23T21:52:17Z

"On a more serious note, it's all about growing into your current setup and refining your coffee skills with what you have. 

I started espresso with a blade grinder, a Mr Coffee steam espresso maker, and a pound of Starbucks coffee. After watching plenty of videos, I modded my Mr Coffee to work at a higher brew pressure and learned how to temperature surf very well. I overhauled the steam wand, and ended up using it as a pressure machine. I got bored there and decided to expand my horizons into turkish coffee, aeropress, and moka pot all while using a Chemex as my daily driver. The point here is that you need an innate understanding of coffee before an expensive setup is beneficial. You could buy a Marzocco and get horrible (and messy) results if you don't know what you're doing with it. Take absolutely no shame in starting small....it's much better to screw up a $50 coffee maker before sacrificing your $1k+ machine. 

Personally, I'm a college student who's used some smart investing techniques to receive dividends and cash out when necessary. I stay as far away as I can from crypto, but the good ol' fashioned stock market is a great way of making money on the side. I use a modded Gaggia Classic Pro, Rancilio Silvia, and a Mazzer Super Jolly grinder. I don't have an insane setup yet, but it's getting there.",1642969812,htxageo,espresso,2022-01-23T20:30:12Z

"I have find a somewhat safer strat to beat it solo but it is a bit slow. Instead of the room on the left, go the the right side where the coffee maker is. Everything will funnel in a single file and come through the door way and you have better line of sight due to the windows. With a shotgun and buckshot bruiser, you will be able to hold forever. Furthermore the bots don't really go wander off if you stand on the table.

Take it slow and make sure there is enough time for you and the bots to come back to this room. The bots always get stuck climbing at the police station node. To get around this problem, simply walk out of he police station. The bots will teleport to you as you reach the stairs of front entrance.

The left side has a semi safe place to defend, the very far left corner of the map, just outside the room with two alarmed doors. However this only works if you and the bots have over half health as you are guaranteed to lose health if you defend here. If your bots have too little health, go all the way back to the start and use the first aid cabinet to heal. Remember the bots can heal multiple times with the first aid cabinet, but there is a time cooldown.

The right side is rather simple to defend since there is tool kit room with a first aid cabinet to heal. It can get a bit hectic if a tallboy or bruiser manage to get in. However with a full team of bots and and if have them use the first aid before the horde start, you won't lose here.",1642953990,htw5pu6,Back4Blood,2022-01-23T16:06:30Z

First is mental illness and chronic pain. Waking up is really difficult for me. So even if I set my alarm an hour early, my body will keep me in bed until I ‚Äúhave‚Äù to get up. And even then it‚Äôs slow going. I need that extra 10, 20 minutes or my body is shot some days. 

Also with certain mental health issues you misunderstand how time flows. I will believe only minutes have passed but it‚Äôs actually a half hour. I didn‚Äôt do anything where did the time go?! 

I also have adhd which means if I have 2 tasks, get dressed and make coffee. That should take me 20 minutes tops. But i get side tracked. I have to add water to the coffee maker cuz it‚Äôs out. I notice a plant is too dry and needs some water and while I‚Äôm already getting water, I might as well, as I place that down I notice my coffee cup needs a wash since it sat and now is dusty so I wash it and while I‚Äôm washing it I realize my shoes need a quick wipe so I do that. So on and so forth all morning. And that‚Äôs just for work. 

Now if I‚Äôm going out. I plan two hours ahead of time to shower and do a full face of makeup. I know from past experience I can complete this in two hours. But then I have to take a pill, find an outfit, I look awful and fat so now I have to change five times to something I feel more comfortable in. I sneezed so I smudged my makeup. I don‚Äôt like how my foundation went on, better wash it all off and start all over. So my insecurities over my appearance will cause an extra hour or even two to my time. 

I have anxiety over being the first person there. Even on time I‚Äôll wait in my car until I see someone else has walked in. 

I‚Äôm very forgetful so I might have to go back home to get something. 

I don‚Äôt take care of things when I should do things go wrong because I didn‚Äôt fix them when I knew there was an issue. My battery is going on my car. I should get a new one. I know I have to charge my car in the morning or it won‚Äôt start. But I still haven‚Äôt gotten a new battery. It‚Äôs a lot. 

My brain is just a mess. So I try to mitigate how much it affects other people, apologize a lot, forewarn people about always being late, tell people to lie to me about times so that I‚Äôm actually on time, let my employer know how much I struggle and work on a game plan, etc. it‚Äôs sucks but it could be worse I guess.",1642908428,htu09hk,AskReddit,2022-01-23T03:27:08Z

"**Part 1**

Huh.  Snow on Midway Atoll.  You would think that with all of the weird, amazing and horrible events occurring in the world over the last two decades that inclement weather on a subtropical island wouldn't be surprising.  I guess being away from home due to the Siren War and stationed on a palm tree-covered island for four years affected me more than I thought.

Who am I, I hear you asking.  Well, that's a long story, so I'll give you the cliff notes.  My name is Felix ""Dead Man's Shoes"" Kingry, Commodore of the Maple Monarchy Navy, serving as the Base Commander for Azur Lane's Central Pacific detachment.  And right now, I'm feeling a touch of childhood nostalgia shining through the cracks in the scars of numbness I had built up over my time in the service as I make for my closet.

""Kommandant?""  Asked a curious voice and slightly impatient voice, ""What are you going to do about this?""

I look over my shoulder to KMS Admiral Hipper, lead ship of her class and the Kansen who most frequently rotated back in as my secretary.  Hipper and I were an odd duo, she a young-looking, vibrant and excitable blonde prone to snapping at just about anyone; and me, an emotionally-drained, greying, near-middle-aged man with a nasty streak that no one ever saw coming.  One would assume that we would grate on each other to no end, but they would be wrong.  I learned a little too slowly that the bevy of Kansen under my new command were as unique in personalities as they were in looks, and required different approaches to working together.  Hipper, for example, worked well with me when I took a direct, strictly business approach with her and very clearly separated work and free time.  Once I had figured this out, she stopped insulting me, treated me with equal respect and we had developed an excellent working relationship.  I don't know that I would call her a friend, but we did occasionally retire to my home after work for dinner and a quiet drink, after which she would take the guest room if she did not feel like dealing with the other members of the base's Iron Blood detachment, more specifically her younger sister Prinz Eugen.

""Well, the first thing I'm going to do is get dressed Hipper, so could you please wait outside?"" I asked as I picked out my duty uniform.  In lieu of a response, Hipper nodded and snapped off a salute before exiting my bedroom.  Two minutes later, I emerged from my bedroom in the long-sleeved version of my officer's uniform, compounded by an article of clothing I was extremely glad I had acquired for no reason other than it looked cool: A boat cloak.

Hipper cocked an eyebrow when she saw what I was wearing.  ""Where'd you get that?"" She asked.

""Got it a while back just because, and I'm glad I did."" I answered, opening a side closet off my kitchen and searching for the spare jacket and two shovels I had stuffed in there.

""So what are you going to do about this?"" she asked again, slightly more impatiently this time.  Luckily, I found what I was looking for.

""For starters, *we* are going to dig ourselves out of here."" I answered, handing her a shovel and the far-too-light-for-this-weather jacket.  The look of bewildered indignance on her face was almost funny.

""Huh?  You - I - What?!"" She sputtered.  ""Do you not see just *how much* snow is out there?!"" She exclaimed.

""I do, and remember Hipper, I'm from the Maple Monarchy.  Back home, we call this Tuesday."" I replied, opening the front door and attacking the wet wall of snow.

""I know where you're from!  It's just... why?  You can do your work from here!"" She pointed out, waving one of her arms in the general direction of my home office as I started to dig a ramp away from my front door.

""True.  What I *can't* do from home is access the base intercoms to make an announcement everyone can hear immediately, or dig out snowed-in Kansen who most likely don't have any tools available to do the same.  Now, are you going to stand there and keep jabbering or are you going to help me shovel before the snow starts to melt and get even harder to deal with?"" I asked with a note of command in my voice.  Hipper remained still for a moment before throwing on the jacket, grimacing and sallying forth to attack the waist-high drifts with me.  Once we had dug ourselves out of the entrance to my home, we began our trudge to the Command Centre.  Luckily there was no wind, and the temperature was hovering somewhere around 0^o C. I was able to keep mostly from falling deep into the banks through careful footing, while Hipper found herself sinking frequently, which when coupled with the cold air, did not improve her mood.  For those few moments I felt like Legolas, standing atop the snowdrifts as the Fellowship traversed the Pass of Caradhras.

""Did you really get this much snow back home, Kommandant?"" Hipper asked, taking a momentary break from grumbling under her breath.

""Every year.  I'm from a city wedged between two of the Great Lakes, so we always got a lot of lake effect snow.  And when one of those storm systems rolls in, it rolls in hard and fast.  Most times three feet of snow within twenty-four hours is barely enough to slow down a work day."" I respond as we reach the half-submerged front door of the Command Centre.  Hipper's eyes widened but she didn't say anything, choosing instead just to help me shovel.  We excavated the entrance in record time, and without decorum, shook our sodden shoes, boots and (in Hipper's case) stockings free of clinging snow and slush before heading up to the communications section.

""I've got this part, so can you get a pot of coffee going please, Hipper? We're going to need it."" I requested  as I sat down at the mic.

""*Jawohl* Kommandant,"" Hipper affirmed, making for the attached break room and the coffee-maker it contained.  While she was occupied, I keyed up the mic and broadcast over the base-wide intercom system:

*""Attention all Azur Lane personnel, this is Commodore Felix Kingry speaking.  As I'm sure you are all aware, the base has experienced a deluge of snow, which is most certainly going to affect operations to a considerable degree.  As such, effective immediately, I am suspending all but the most essential of fleet duties until this snow is dealt with.  Those that wish to contribute should find a shovel, inform me of your intentions via IM and meet me at the Command Centre to formulate a plan.  To all Kansen who believe they are incapable of assisting, please consider staying inside, or dress warmly and use caution if you wish to venture out into the snow.  That is all.""* I switch off the intercom and leaned back in the chair, letting out a put-upon sigh.

*It's going to be a long day* I thought as Hipper returned with two steaming cup of coffee in hand.",1642888890,htspu2d,AzureLane,2022-01-22T22:01:30Z
"I don't have personal experience with this, so take it with a grain of salt, but one of my friends has a well with hard water and a tankless gas water heater.

They have it serviced once a year, where a guy comes out and flushes the insides to get rid of any mineral deposits. This is definitely something you can do yourself, but my friends are elderly and would rather pay someone to take care of it. So really it's just an extra maintenance step. If your water is super hard, you may have to flush it twice a year instead of once a year.

And regarding your coffee maker, brewing a pot of vinegar once every couple of months should keep it alive.

And honestly, longer-term, look into a pricey water treatment system. That way you only have to maintain that instead of having to deal with constant mineral buildup everywhere.",1642888709,htspdw0,homestead,2022-01-22T21:58:29Z

"There isn't a real answer with the information given. You really need to know your power consumption. Batteries are a very small component of your system. 
Lithium Battery? Gel? Or 6v golf cart batteries?

You mentioned 360w panel for each battery, but... is this 6 200Ah batteries, or 12 100Ah batteries? How many panels are you actually getting onto your roof?

Your panels will supply the power, and the way you set them up will establish the voltage and the amperage. Your charge controller will help decide if you're using the panels to power your appliances first, or charging the batteries first. There's a thousand different equations you need to research first.

I have 8 250watt panels on my roof 2S3P. (I think that's how you write it). each pair of panels gives me 74ish volts of electricity. I have never seen the full 2000 watts come in, I'm averaging 700-900 watts a day in the southeastern winter right now. But that's enough to fill my batteries every day, (I bought used batteries, I have 16 3.4 volt batteries, I think they're100Ah each) and run things for 2 days in the rain.

"God do I feel that man... My wife has been obsessed with fertility related shit lately, and she said this morning ""this book made me realize I'm not getting enough protein.""

I laughed and she asked why I was laughing, to which I said ""Honey I've been telling you that for years, why didn't you believe me ever?""

The female psychology is weird man. They won't listen to someone who has dedicated years of time to learning all about the different pros and cons, where to start, how things are different for different people, etc, but as soon as some random Mombie says ""you have to do this because otherwise you'll rot away,"" the world will flip over to accomplish it.

Another example (this one is lunacy): a Podcaster references a study citing plastics as being bad for you. Obviously we have all heard and know the danger of microplastics, but my wife has taken it to the extreme of getting rid of EVERYTHING plastic in the house that is used for food/liquid. Bowls, cups, etc. She isn't using the coffee maker because it has ""plastic"" in it. God forbid I explain what BPA free plastic means, or that silicone is not the same as plastic, or ""don't you think if all of this stuff was dangerous, no one would be using it at all?""

I'm all for upgrading to glass, it's easier to clean, and the plastic bowls were old and scratched and probably needed to go, but the fucking coffee maker? She even tried to throw away my shaker bottles that still have the BPA free sticker... Absolute lunacy, so I've learned to ignore what I can and just..

"I mix water and coconut oil and throw in the avb. The water acts as a temperature buffer so the oil won‚Äôt burn. 

 Letting it steep for more than a half hour is unnecessary imo. After that most of the goodies are infused and you‚Äôre just leeching chlorophyll. 

When it‚Äôs done steeping, I stain through an Aeropress (a $30 coffee maker) with a single paper filter. Then I put the plant matter back in a pot with more water And stain again. There isn‚Äôt much oil left, but I get what I can. 

After it‚Äôs stained, I put it in a large bowl and put it in the fridge. The oil separates from the water and turns to a solid. 

Press your oil chunks on paper towels and store in the fridge. You can reheat and put it into a small jar but I like to keep it in small chucks that I can add to whatever.

"These are a few things I've started doing more recently that have helped me. They may or may not help you so take what helps and leave the rest! 

One thing is that for areas that I can't easily see what's in it but I need to remember what's there, I have a dry erase board with sort of an inventory. For example, in my kitchen I have cabinet that's not very accessible and I keep things like extra rice that I don't need to open yet or things I bought two of when they were on sale but I haven't used the first one yet. I have a dry erase board on the inside of the cabinet where I keep the majority of my food, and it just has a list of everything that's back there so I can easily look at it and know what I have and if I'm actually out of something or not. I also do this for a bin I have with extra shampoo, toothpaste, etc. If I don't have extras of those kinds of things I will just run out and there have been multiple times where I forgot to buy something because I thought there was one in there but I didn't check the bin. It's easier to just check a list, and it's also easier for me to remember that if I erase something off of that list, it needs to go on a shopping list.

Another thing that sounds kind of silly but for some reason I never realized I could just do, is I keep things in the places that I use them, and in places that makes sense to me, even if they don't make sense to others or aren't ""correct"". For example, I have a pantry cabinet in my kitchen that I always struggled to organize because it's very deep and anything that was in the back I couldn't see, and it was hard to get to. I now keep all of my tupperwares in the pantry and my food is kept in a regular kitchen cabinet. This works so much better for me but every time I tried to organize before I felt like I had to keep food in the pantry because that's where it's ""supposed to"" go. I also have two different silverware drawers because I use certain ones to stir my coffee/tea and I have certain ones I take with me to work when I pack my lunch. So those are in a separate drawer that's close to the coffee maker and fridge because that's where I need them. The rest of my utensils are near where I keep my dishes because that's where I am when I want them. 

The last minor thing is just labels! I have a label maker and even if I logically know what is supposed to go in a particular box or drawer, for some reason labeling it helps me. 


I apologize, that ended up with a lot more rambling than I intended but hope there's at least something in there that could help :)",1642860010,htqrok1,ADHD,2022-01-22T14:00:10Z

"That's a difficult question to answer without know who you are, but my main suggestion is to be intentional about it.

Keep people in your life who have healthy relationships. If you don't know how to identify a healthy relationship, read or take a class. Ask questions like this. If you have a partner and you've hit a communication block, don't be afraid to go to therapy -- my wife and I did for two sessions after we'd been living together for a year (unmarried) and it really unlocked a lot.

The main things are having a foundation of fundamentally liking one another and making communication/negotiation a habit. It helps foster a feeling of ""wow my partner does a lot for me"" being felt by both sides.

The specifics change from relationship to relationship, and evolve over time.

Small examples from my life:

* I hate getting up early. If we have a trip that involves getting up early, my partner will usually buy canned coffee or set our coffee maker the night before, even though I'm usually the one who sets up the coffee maker for normal days.

* Partner likes a made bed. I don't care either way, but hate doing it in the morning. If I go to the office, I won't do it, but if I'm WFH, I make sure it's done before they get home in the evening (usually on my lunch break).

* Normally, my partner cooks and I clean (load/unload dishwasher). Sometimes after a few days of doing nothing but one we get tired, and will soft switch -- my partner will unload the dishwasher and I'll do the prep for the dinner, as an example. It's almost never discussed anymore, it just happens because one of us will notice the other is shifting what they normally do. Sometimes one of us will just say ""I really can't do X today"" and if the other is feeling fine we'll just jump in.

* Driving to a friend's house or party where there will be drinking, we have a general on/off schedule but make accommodations for if it's a friend that is closer to one person or the other, or if someone's had a shit week, or many other circumstances. Sometimes we both really want to be able to, and then talk about okay, do we want to do public transit, try to stay over, Uber/Lyft, etc. It sounds like a *lot* to negotiate but mostly it takes about 20 seconds because it's as routine as tying your shoes.

I hope that helps.",1642844153,htq3jme,AdviceAnimals,2022-01-22T09:35:53Z

""Hey everyone, using this to make coffee and need to return it in 2 months. Feel free to use it but just to be abundantly clear, I do not value any of your lives worth more than a bill, if you break it, we will have problems"".

It was meant to be a joke but another housemate said 'hey, I get you don't want to folks to break it but you can word it without sounding like a threat or dismissing our lives, kind of makes you sound like an asshole bluntly""

"Learning how to cook at home is a good start. If you have all the cookwear, great. If not, you‚Äôll need for just yourself an 8‚Äù pan or two, a small and medium pot, a cooking spoon and spatula, and a pair of tongs. You can find these cheap in many places. TJ Maxx, Marshalls, thrift shops can be good. Might even find them online. If you‚Äôre interested in learning to bake things a couple cookie sheets or even casserole dishes can help you learn to bake dinners. Head over to r/eatcheapandhealthy and they can provide a lot more guidance on foods. lol could write a lot but they have a lot more varied advice. If you don‚Äôt like cooking all that much slow cookers come in smaller sizes. You can get premixed stuff (slightly more costly but still cheaper than eating out by far) and toss that and some meat in the slow cooker with proper amounts of water. I had a rice cooker gifted to me while in school. It was wonderful to set it and have a snack of rice with little work. Check out YouTube and the internet for cooking stuff. Even PBS has a cooking show. 

Beverages: check out the frozen section. They have frozen drinks in concentrate. That lemonade tastes good on a hot day. If you like tea, start buying from grocers in bags or loose leaf. If you like coffee there are moka pots, south indian tumbler style, Vietnamese style, pour over, etc. even just a basic coffee maker at home would save money. If its fizzy drinks you like, try and get into fizzy water if possible. It helps stave off soda purchases for some. 

Get into budgeting. Like hardcore. Track your expenses. See where your money is going. Are you spending a ton on transportation? Can you spend less? Speaking of, whats your insurance like? Are you buying both groceries and eating out? Is some of that food going bad in the process? Do you live in a state that charges and taxes for bottles and cans? Make sure to return them for a refund if possible. Whats your rent like? What are your clothing expenses like? Can you thrift some clothes? What about medical care? It may not be imminent now, but gain some basic knowledge now and it could help later. 

Heres one big thing thats hard to do but can help if an emergency happens: put away a few dollars each month. More if possible. Its not always possible.

"It was a post of an office worker in Uber, showing the amenities offered to these staff members and inviting the comparison to drivers who obviously don‚Äôt get to roll in to their office gym with a fancy coffee maker and built-in food bar for lunch etc. While the post itself from social media was straight cringe, I‚Äôll agree that it didn‚Äôt fit the sub as it was mostly just pitting the workers against one another. I have no idea where the sexism talk came in, as when I was there the most openly sexist comments visible to me were saying that someone that young going right to corporate must have had a connection, which is one example I see being cited as sexist. Personally, I can see why people may be triggered by that given the age-old sexist comments that women who get good jobs must have slept their way to the top or otherwise don‚Äôt deserve their job but I think it‚Äôs a leap to suggest that anyone who sees tone deaf Instagram folks showing off their lifestyle of luxury is sexist for thinking they probably were connected before their swanky office gig. Perhaps that was the dog whistle that invited the sexism to really get going. I‚Äôm assuming the thread did derail into more overt sexist shit given the influx of ‚Äúthis sub is full of misogyny‚Äù posts this afternoon and here we are now. Hopefully we can clear the air and move on in a more healthy way.",1642825514,htp8w5j,antiwork,2022-01-22T04:25:14Z

"This is the newest post so I chose it to copy paste this article

Two years into the pandemic, rundown bungalows command bidding wars, buyers keep snatching up places they‚Äôve never seen, and homebuilders can‚Äôt find enough cabinet doors for everyone who wants a new home. The median price for an American home is up nearly 20 percent in a year. The for-sale inventory is at a new low. And the hopeful buyers left on the sidelines have helped drive up rents instead.

All of this may feel unsustainable ‚Äî the tight inventory, the wild price growth, the dwindling affordability. Surely something‚Äôs got to give.

But what if that‚Äôs not exactly true? Or, at least, not true anytime soon for renters locked out of homeownership today or anyone worried about housing affordability. There‚Äôs probably no quick reprieve coming, no rollback in stratospheric home prices if you can just wait a little longer to jump in.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a bubble, it really is about the fundamentals,‚Äù said Jenny Schuetz, a housing researcher at the Brookings Institution. ‚ÄúIt really is about supply and demand ‚Äî not enough houses, and huge numbers of people wanting homes.‚Äù

Neither side of that ledger has a quick fix. More than six million existing homes sold in 2021, the highest number since 2006, according to data published Thursday by the National Association of Realtors. But that was still well short of satisfying demand. And there‚Äôs little evidence to suggest the nation is in a hurry to correct the imbalance between supply and demand.

‚ÄúMy pessimistic view is that the economy is perfectly capable of running with unaffordable housing,‚Äù said Daryl Fairweather, the chief economist at Redfin. This was evident over the last decade, she said, when affordability worsened even as the economy continued to grow. And that reality has enabled politicians and the public to largely neglect the issue of housing affordability.

‚ÄúAnother way to phrase that is people will still get up and go to their jobs, even if they‚Äôre housing insecure,‚Äù Ms. Fairweather said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs one reason to think we‚Äôll still just keep letting this problem get worse.‚Äù

More housing construction will help ‚Äî and it has been increasing ‚Äî but the United States has been underbuilding for so long that it‚Äôll take years to meet demand.

You might also expect home buyers to get fed up with soaring prices. But that answer falters in, say, Salt Lake City when asking prices that look absurd to local buyers seem reasonable to someone moving in from Seattle.

Today, first-time home buyers in once-affordable markets have competition from all kinds of sources that didn‚Äôt exist a generation ago: from global capital, from all-cash ‚ÄúiBuyers‚Äù that size up homes by algorithm, from institutional investors renting single-family homes, from smaller-scale investors running Airbnbs.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really hard for an owner-occupier to compete with the amount of money that‚Äôs flowing into this region,‚Äù said Dan Immergluck, a professor at Georgia State in Atlanta. There, even in a Sun Belt market with robust new housing construction, supply still can‚Äôt keep up with demand.

Perhaps at some point in the medium term, the geographic reshuffling of remote workers will settle down, calming price growth in places like Boise, Idaho, and Denver that have been most jolted by it. But the investor purchasers aren‚Äôt going away. Nor are new technologies that enable homes to sell at a much faster pace.

Rising mortgage rates should help slow the growth in home prices. But they won‚Äôt affect anyone paying cash. And higher rates will make home owning even less affordable.

‚ÄúFor first-time home buyers, they‚Äôre going to find it very, very difficult to get a home in the next two, three years,‚Äù said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody‚Äôs Analytics. And in the meantime they‚Äôll be paying higher rents, cutting into their ability to save for a down payment.

Working-class households on the cusp of homeownership before the pandemic may now need another five to 10 years to play catch-up, said Ralph McLaughlin, the chief economist at Kukun, a company that tracks real estate investment activity. The days of one-earner households buying a decent-quality starter home anywhere in the U.S. may be over, he said ‚Äî unless that one earner is a high earner.

‚ÄúAs a housing economist, it‚Äôs kind of depressing to think that there may not be an undoing of the hardships that have been brought upon young households trying to get their foot in the door of the housing market‚Äù during the pandemic, Mr. McLaughlin said.

Those hardships have been remarkably widespread across the country. The last time such home price growth occurred was in the years leading up to the housing crash. But even at the height of the bubble in 2006, only about 40 percent of metro areas experienced greater than 10 percent annual home price growth. In the past year, 80 percent of metros have seen such spikes. And a quarter of all metro areas have had price rises of more than 20 percent.


Widespread pain in the rental market has followed. In 2021, communities across the country experienced the kind of double-digit rent growth seen only before the pandemic in small oil or fracking boom towns, said Igor Popov, the chief economist at Apartment List. Now, he said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs going to be challenging to imagine a world where the affordability concerns start to wane.‚Äù

None of this is rooted in the kind of risky borrowing that inflated the housing bubble. Rather, home buyers flush with pandemic savings and strong credit have been taking out conventional loans (if they‚Äôre taking out loans at all). The rental market has experienced a rise in higher-income households, too, at a time when new household formation has also surged with young adults who began the pandemic by moving back home.

Add to all of this a few more forces stressing the housing market even without a pandemic: Baby boomers who own a lot of housing stock are sticking around in their primary homes longer than previous generations did, at a time millennials have reached peak home-buying age. That ties up existing supply.

Local governments have further stymied new housing supply with zoning and building restrictions that will remain a problem even when home-building supply chain kinks resolve. And looking forward, climate change means that a growing share of housing supply that exists today may be uninhabitable or require expensive retrofits in the future, said Ms. Fairweather, the Redfin economist.

That is a lot to be glum about ‚Äî unless, of course, you already own a home and are happy to see its value skyrocketing.

But that brings us back to Ms. Fairweather‚Äôs point about whether there‚Äôs much public appetite to curb housing costs at all.

"My husband and I have moved seven times in the past ten years, and all but one of the moves has been to a different city/state and a few even long distance. I have some things that work for us. 

Someone recommended PODS, and I haven‚Äôt used them, but instead we use a company called ABF freight and we pack our stuff in steel cubes - ‚ÄúRelo-cubes‚Äù - and they are delivered to the new location. Never had any issues with them, always excellent service. They will also store your cubes at their lots and charge a monthly storage fee if you don‚Äôt have a place yet and want to drive there and find one in person. They‚Äôll deliver when you are ready. 

Start now with your declutter and be brutal. Every house is different and we‚Äôve had to either buy new things for each place, or get rid of things. When I think of all the time and money we could have saved by just starting over with some items. Our one really precious item is our bed. It‚Äôs a custom mattress that we bought like seven years ago and it‚Äôs the most comfortable thing and I never wake up in pain even though I go to sleep in pain. 

Create a manifest for what you are keeping. Obviously you‚Äôll be packing certain things together, like towels with towels or dishes with dishes. Create a few boxes for when you get there that have your essentials in them - sheets, comforter etc, coffee maker, a lamp, a screw driver, etc. Anything you will be needing first. We always buy new pillows when we move. The manifest is a list of what‚Äôs in the boxes. We do it like this: box is labeled with what‚Äôs in it, and fairly detailed, written on top. Every box gets a number, written on all four sides and the top. We write these on a legal pad and list the contents of each box. So when you get to your new place, you know where the can opener or whatever is. We keep the manifests because it‚Äôs a good way to see if we are living with less or not. I set a goal each time to have less boxes than the last. Keep the manifest with you, do not pack it. Writing the number on all sides and top allows you to find the box no matter how it‚Äôs been stacked. 

We use U-Haul boxes and their brown paper tape exclusively. We buy the small size boxes because they have handles and they are a good size. Buy the book boxes for books. They are smaller, but books are heavier, so it balances out and makes them easier to lift. They have so many different styles of boxes, for lamps, art, dishes, whatever. I disagree with the person who suggested plastic bins. Then you‚Äôll have a bunch of bins you need to store. You can flatten these boxes and reuse them, or give them away. They aren‚Äôt that expensive. The paper tape is also brilliant and we always have several rolls on hand even when we aren‚Äôt moving and use it for all our shipping needs. It is strong brown paper tape, and requires no tape dispenser, so it‚Äôs easy to use. It tears with your fingers easily but is super strong. Never had a tape failure. And it‚Äôs more eco friendly than plastic packing tape. 

We‚Äôre getting ready to move in April, and I am going through the same thing right now, decluttering. I‚Äôm trying the Marie Kondo method for the first time and it‚Äôs been going well. I‚Äôm also doing this on my own and allowing my husband to deal with his own stuff when he has time. That‚Äôs been so much healthier for us because I‚Äôm not dependent on him to find a good time, I can literally pick a time that feels good to me and start decluttering. Last week I decluttered about 3/4 of my clothes. I did my books, I use a kindle so what I did have physically wasn‚Äôt much. I‚Äôm working on paper today, and starting with Komono this weekend. I have an art studio in the house and I would like to keep that functional for as long as possible, and I would also like to get most of the purging and packing done now so I can relax, make art and look for the right place to move to in a more pleasant fashion. 

Just be really thorough with your declutter. Get yourself into a good mental state about what you want your life to look like on the other end. Don‚Äôt take anything that you don‚Äôt love.",1642787862,htmkubx,declutter,2022-01-21T17:57:42Z
"You know what would make me more resilient? Maybe getting paid a living wage (EMS here), having ERs not constantly understaffed, and having nurses quit because they got pay CUTS instead of *raises* because ""COVID is tough on everyone"". No shit it is, especially now that I/colleagues make LESS than we did before a freaking pandemic.

But yes, tell me more about this resilience training. Will it teach me how to work a 36 hour shift without wanting to stab myself in the eyes with a 14 Ga needle? Will it train the patients not to treat us like garbage? Or wait a second, will it just end up buying us a new coffee maker and give ""the front line of medicine"" a pay bump?

Surprise! It's the last option! But hold on now, you thought that the front line was ER and ICU? Silly you, the front line is admin and billing! Because without them who would push for the fancy new coffee machine?!

"I once worked on a construction site in Iowa where some Amish laborers came in. Initially they didn't want to use power tools which, ok that makes sense. They saw how much faster some guys with drills and nailguns were going and decide it's not a sin if they use the power tools but they can't plug them in when they die because that's where the real evil comes in, I guess. 

Also almost saw a fight break out because one guy didn't make more coffee after finishing it, maybe because the coffee maker was electric, maybe he just didn't know how to use it/manners for the situation. A non-amish guy who wanted coffee sees this and says if he's not going to hell for drinking electric coffee then he's going to hell for not making a fresh pot cuz God ain't that stupid.",1642785383,htme0tb,news,2022-01-21T17:16:23Z
"For me, the main benefit to an Airbnb is being able to cook. So I absolutely hate it when we rent one and there's the bare minimum cookware (like 2 small/medium frying pans, 1 tiny baking sheet, etc), no spices/oil, etc. When we bought our cabin and got it ready to rent out, I bought commercial-quality cookware and lots of it, very easy to cook for a crowd with 14-inch skillets, stock pots, 3/4 sheet baking sheets, every cooking implement you can think of, lobster crackers and oyster shuckers (Maine necessities) and much much more. Stocked the pantry with spices and oil and keep sugar and flour available as well. 

We also took the opportunity to upgrade some of our appliances at home and brought the extras to the cabin so we have some things like a rice cooker, waffle maker, blender, etc. We offer both an easy drip coffee maker and have a grinder and french press. We stock it with local decent coffee and offer s'mores fixings. 

We have lots of board games, DVDs in case the internet goes out (rural area, can be twitchy in bad weather, also why we keep a landline available for guests to use in an emergency). Heated mats on the deck to our hot tub (posted about this previously- huge success!). Stocked the bathroom with tampons/pads, mini packs of make up wipes, lotion, face wash, etc from the Christmas tree shop. There's also a shampoo/conditioner/soap dispenser in the shower filled with decent products (not $1 bottles of stuff that will strip your hair- curly haired people know what I mean). 

We have tons of throw blankets around the house and extra blankets/pillows in all the guest rooms in case it's cold. We have a detailed house book with lots of information about the house, contact information, and lots of local suggestions for stuff to do. 

We are new parents so decided to keep lots of baby stuff at the house. Most is personal and we keep locked away but guests can use the changing table, high chair, bottle warmer, etc. Makes it a little easier as parents to have some of those basic necessities around (would never expect them at a rental personally but they would be a nice surprise for us).

Finally, our house is up north with skiing, snowmobiling, etc nearby so it was important to us to have good area to boot up in. We set up a little station in the walkout basement (right where the cars are parked outside) with benches (actually scored a church pew at an auction for cheap which is a fun element), heavy duty carpet, table for stuff, places to hang wet gear, and a boot dryer. 

We use our place a lot so obviously a lot of what we did was for our own benefit but our feedback has been amazing for these small touches, we have only 5-star reviews out of the 20 or so rentals we've had so far with guests specifically mentioning these things. Nothing worse to me than renting a place that is very obviously purely a rental with the bare minimum furniture/cooking equipment from Ikea and 0 personal touches. I like a place that feels like a home and I get the sense the owners actually use the space.",1642784382,htmbbef,AirBnB,2022-01-21T16:59:42Z

"Ah ! My favorite question!

Depends on your budget.

First, the method you choose won't affect the quality as much as the coffee you buy. If you want good coffee, you need to pay for good coffee. The method of brewing comes second.

Now, the methods. Below are the 4 most used methods, ranked from cheapest to most expensive.

-Italian coffee maker

Cheap and easy to use. Quantity of coffee cannot be controlled though, you need to fill the coffee maker completely. The coffee maker comes in different sizes though so you can have a 3-cups volume or 10-cups.

-French Press (cafetiere √† piston)

Also cheap and easy, but requires the coffee grains to be grinded less finely than standard (or else the coffee will be too strong and acid).

-Nespresso or senseo machine

Very easy but not as cheap as you need to buy specific coffee capsules.

-Percolateur

Expensive machines from 100‚Ç¨ to 1000‚Ç¨ that comes with more or less functions, can also grind sometimes, or have milk recipes. I'd use this only if I were a coffee connaisseur, with special coffee blends and not what you  find in supermarkets.

"Henry cringed as he watched the spider descend and rise at his will up and down the line of silk from the ceiling. His sister watched in awed fascination as it slipped down quickly then it's little legs reversed and climbed itself back up the tiny rope. 

""Ugh,"" Henry said watching through slitted eyes, ""this is awful. of all things. Why spiders?""

""Is it just spiders?"" Mary asked, completely enthralled, ""do you have any idea how cool that is?""

""It's disgusting,"" he spat, clearly upset, ""I get shivers down my spine every time I see them. Luckily I can just make them go away now. I suppose that's nice at least.""

""You have no idea how *lucky* you are!"" Mary protested, ""do you have any idea what I'd give to have a superpower? Have you decided on a name yet?""

""Well, the one I would have wanted is taken,"" Henry said with a mock sigh, ""no, I don't think I've got the stomach to fight anyone with a legion of spiders - it seems cruel.""

""Henry, you could do good with this!"" Mary said.

""It's gross,"" he said flatly, ""didn't you ever read the web series *Worm?* Thank God it's just spiders.""

Henry shivered, his shoulders trembling, he threw up his hands and go to his feet, sending the spider scurrying away. 

""Noooo,"" whined Mary, ""c'mon bro.""

""No,"" he snapped, ""I'm getting a cup of coffee."" 

""So is is any kind of spider?"" she asked.

""*Yes*,"" he said, anger coming into his voice, ""please, Mary stop, I can feel them get agitated when I feel defensive.""

""Oh,"" she said, looking around herself, ""right.""

Henry scooped some old Folgers into his filter and dropped it into the top of his coffee maker and swung the lid closed before pressing the on button.

""Be a couple minutes,"" he said eyeing her over the breakfast bar, ""don't tell mom or dad this will you?"" 

""No worries,"" she grinned, ""your secret's save with me, Pete.""

""And no jokes,"" he said, eyebrows raised seriously, ""I mean it. I hate this.""

""Oh c'mon,"" she giggled, ""how often do I get to give you shit, you were always their favorite. Did better in school than I did, were less of a pain to raise, all that.""

""I was the second kid,"" he reasoned, ""second one is always easier.""

""Yeah, yeah,"" she said.

""I think I'm going to move,"" Henry said, listening to the dripping stream of coffee gurgle in front of him, ""somewhere colder.""

""You'd be the king of the continent if you moved to Australia,"" Mary reasoned, ""think about it.""

""Oh fuck off,"" Henry hissed, his shoulders hiking up around his neck, ""no, no, no.""

""God, you're very sensitive about them aren't you,"" she said, ""I figured controlling them would give you some kind of comfort, not more fear.""

""You don't get it,"" he said, ""I can... *feel* them.""

""That does sound a bit like that *Worm* girl story, doesn't it?"" Mary said.

""You *did* read it!"" Henry shouted, pointing at her.

""Yeah, yeah it was a good one,"" she nodded, smirking. 

""Then you get it, this is fucked,"" he said, eyeing the slowly filling pot.

""Maybe you could get a job at a circus or a zoo or something,"" suggested Mary, ""they have tarantulas and stuff at those places.""

""Fuck. Off."" he said flatly, ""I'm moving to Antarctica.""

Mary giggled more while she stared enviously at her brother. Finally after a few moments he grew impatient and poured out two cups of coffee and slammed the carafe back under the filter reservoir before more came out.

""You do two sugars and half and half still, yeah?"" he asked.

""Yep,"" she nodded. 

Henry set about sugaring their coffee and did half the sugar in his own before adding half and half to both mugs. He walked hers over and let her take it. 

""Google that would you?"" he asked.

""What?"" she said taking a sip.

""Areas in the world without spiders,"" he said.

""I'm not letting you move,"" she said angrily, ""you're not leaving me all alone here.""

""Just - just humor me, please,"" he said.

Henry sipped his coffee in silence while pacing around his apartment. The shivers struck him again sending Mary into another fit of giggles while she thumbed over the screen on her phone.

""Yeah, it looks they can live in Antarctica,"" she nodded,

""Are you *shitting* me?"" Henry asked.

""Nope, listen to this,"" she nodded, ""there are only a handful of locations on earth where spiders cannot be found-

""Fuuuuck,"" groaned Henry.

""-Hush, listen,"" she said, ""among these are the areas are the world's oceans-

""House boat!"" he shouted happily, ""I'll get a house boat. Boom.""

""Hush, let m finish,"" she said, ""let me keep looking around.""

""Ocean sounds lovely,"" Henry said.

""You've never seen the ocean,"" she said.

""Have too,"" he argued, mumbling ""movies and stuff.""

""Yeah,"" she finally nodded, setting her phone down, ""looks like house boat. Just worry about little stowaways.""

Henry frowned back, pacing, and sipping at his mug.

""Coffee good?"" he asked, ""I always make it a bit too dark.""

""Nah, it's good,"" she smirked, sipping.

""Look up house boats,"" he said.

Mary snatched her phone up again and her thumb began gliding across the face once more.

""Eeehhh, could be round ten grand,"" she said after a few seconds.

""I can save up a bit, my emergency fund isn't nearly close to that, not even a third of that,"" he sighed, ""but I'll start saving.""

""You wouldn't rather just practice and get to know the little Anansi buggers?""

""Anansi?"" asked Henry, ""that a species of spider?""

""You read *Worm* but you've never read Gaiman?"" Mary asked, shocked.

""I read Sandman,"" he said defensively.

""Oh you've got to read *Anansi Boys*,"" she said, ""it was *amazing*.""

""I'll think about it,"" he grumbled.

""Anansi is a spider God, from Africa,"" she said.

""I'm sure as shit not going there then,"" he sighed.

""He's sorta like Loki,"" she continued, ""but he's a God of stories and very cunning apparently.""

""I'm not calling myself Anansi-Man,"" Henry laughed.

""You're not worthy of Anansi's title I'm afraid,"" scoffed Mary, ""you'd be Octo-dork or... something.""

""Keep looking at house boats,"" he sighed, ""try and find a cheap one.""",1642768887,htlalkt,WritingPrompts,2022-01-21T12:41:27Z

"‚ÄúSky Master?"" The Nurse asked out loud, reading a name off the sign in sheet. I stood up and walked to the reception's desk.  

""Here, fill this out,‚Äù The Nurse told me.  I thanked her, took the clipboard she handed me, and sat down.  The OR was nearly empty tonight. The holidays offer a sort of truce amongst the heroes and villains only because so many are off on vacation or have family visiting that they do not have time to work. In 19 minutes, it‚Äôll be Christmas. I did not leave town this year so I figured I‚Äôd try to help others have a safe Christmas.   
  
Parents would keep the presents they bought for their kids in their car trucks. Their kids would never find them there. But thieves? Thieves like to wait for the night before Christmas. They would find parents that are unloading gifts from the car to their house and strike. No need to worry about breaking into cars or homes. Just find them when they are most vulnerable. Electronics were a big seller this year. Two new gaming consoles hit the market, and scalpers are already asking 3-4x the price for them. I managed to stop two groups of thieves without trouble but the last set had advanced weaponry. They managed to hit my shoulder with an energy blast. Not fatal or anything, just painful and could lead to issues if not treated.  
  
As I began filling out the paper work, I noticed an old foe sitting in the corner. He had his head down, I couldn‚Äôt see his face, but his white and orange glowing skull costume motive, I knew it was Omega Skull. His shoulders were shaking. Is he laughing at me? I decided to ignore him. Breaking the Surgeon‚Äôs truce isn‚Äôt worth it. It takes a few minutes to fill the paperwork and handed it back to The Nurse.  
  
‚ÄúHe will be with you shortly,‚Äù she said, looking over the paperwork to make sure I did not miss anything.  
  
I sat back down and looked after at Omega Skull again. His head was still in his hands, shoulders shaking. The coffee machine was nearby. That‚Äôs a good enough reason for me. I checked my watch. 11:48 PM.  I walked over the to coffee maker, selected a Columbian roast (decaf) pod, and put it in. In about a minute, the machine had warmed up and started to pour out a cup of coffee.  
  
‚ÄúKinda fancy for a doctor‚Äôs office,‚Äù I said to no one in particular, while also trying to get Omega Skull‚Äôs attention. He didn‚Äôt say a word. He‚Ä¶sniffled? ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen you since last June when we battled along the wharf.‚Äù   
  
He continued to ignore me. ‚ÄúI got hit by some random thieves who fired one of Dr. Future‚Äôs guns.  You wouldn‚Äôt happen to know anything about how they got a hold of that weaponry, do you?‚Äù  
  
Omega Skull continued to remain silent.   
  
‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm talking to you,‚Äù I demanded.   
  
In a split second, he stood up, grabbed me by the throat and slammed me on the wall.   
  
‚ÄúNOT. TODAY.‚Äù he said.  He didn‚Äôt have his mask on. His eyes were red. He was crying.  
  
‚ÄúNO FIGHTING,‚Äù The Nurse shouted and with that, he dropped me and sat back down.  
  
After a second or two to regain my composure, I asked ‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶are you okay?‚Äù   
  
Silence.    
  
He was hurting. Not from physical pain. From something else. I didn‚Äôt see a villain. I saw someone who was angry, sad, frustrated and vulnerable all rolled into one. He needed help. He needed a friend.  
  
I sat down near him. I didn‚Äôt press the issue. I didn‚Äôt say a word. He continued to cry silently in his hands. After about 10 minutes, he finally said something.  
  
‚ÄúMy daughter‚Ä¶.my daughter is in there,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know it was her‚Ä¶.I hurt her‚Ä¶‚Äù he said, looking down as his powerful hands. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶did this. I hurt my own daughter. I‚Äôm‚Ä¶‚Äù he stopped for a second to compose himself.   
  
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs only 15. And has powers. Flight. Energy blasts. She calls herself Crimson Blast. She‚Äôs part of The Crew. You know. The teenage heroes. They attacked my base‚Ä¶they had intel that I had stolen some government project. But I swear, I didn‚Äôt. It was someone else. I don‚Äôt even deal with government heists anymore. Too much to lose for a minor gain. They attacked my base. I fought back. They were no match for me. Why would they even attack? They were outclassed. Inexperienced. Weak.  They knew I would win. Why the hell did they attack? What kind‚Ä¶.what kind of leader even plans that?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúTeens these days are trying to make a name for themselves. Taking you down would do that,‚Äù I said.  
  
‚ÄúThey attacked. And I fought back. I wanted to make an example of them. I didn‚Äôt hold back. As they were retreating, she‚Ä¶‚Äù he stops himself. Takes a deed breath. ‚ÄúShe fired. She was protecting one of her downed teammates. I didn‚Äôt want to kill him. But she was protecting him. She got me in the leg. So I unleashed‚Ä¶‚Äù he stops again.   
  
A few moments pass.  ‚ÄúThey left her behind. What kind of‚Ä¶.they left her behind. She was hurt. She needed them. SHE PROTECTED THEM. AND THEY LEFT HER BEHIND,‚Äù he got angry. He had every right to be angry. ‚ÄúShe was hurt bad. As I got closer to her, I noticed‚Ä¶.I noticed her birthmark on the side of her face. She always hated it. She wanted to get plastic surgery to get rid of it. But I told her it made her unique. It wasn‚Äôt that noticeable. But I noticed it. Just there. On the side of her cheek. Her mask had burned off with my attack. That‚Äôs when I knew it was my little girl. And what I had done to her‚Ä¶‚Äù he stopped. He looked at his feet for a long time.  
  
  
‚ÄúThis is all my fault‚Ä¶‚Äù he said.   
  
He looked defeated, exhausted, angry, and vulnerable.   
  
The Surgeon came out.   
  
Omega Skull stood up.  ‚ÄúIs‚Ä¶is she‚Ä¶?‚Äù  
  
The Nurse walked up next to him and grabbed the clipboard.  
  
‚ÄúShe has multiple fractures, a collapsed lung, first and second degree burns.  But we managed to stabilize her. She‚Äôs awake and alert. She‚Äôll have to stay here for a few nights, but using our medical tech, she should be cured within a week,‚Äù The Nurse said.  
  
Omega Skull breathed a sigh of relief.   
  
‚ÄúDo you want to go see her?‚Äù The Nurse asked.

Same with cheap e-bikes. They are designed to last a few years when used for a trip or two per day. They aren't designed for commercial use, which is exactly what being a food courier is. It's using the e-bike in a business fashion for an entire working day.

Don‚Äôt stress packing stuff that isn‚Äôt particularly breakable; clothes, toys, books. Instead focus on the glass and heavy stuff. 

NOTE; Boxes should be packed according to their size. Books and heavy stuff in small boxes and pillows/comforters in really big boxes. 

If you need to pack something, there‚Äôs probably a box available for it. Most notably wardrobe boxes for any clothes you wan packed hanging up. (There‚Äôs also room for nice shoes below).

"&gt;My commute is 5 minutes. So, 10min there and back. 

Oh that helps a lot at least.

As for the stuff,

* Career learning is def something you seem to want to prioritize. Better job will help have money and time. No idea how to make that easier beyond making all your study stuff comfortable and easy to get. 
* Actually depending where you work, can you come in early and study in break room? Doesn't help the immediate issue of morning zombie, but may be easier to study once you've gotten dressed and walked there. This'll absolutely depend on job, hours, what your studying, and culture of job. 
* How are you about audio books? That might be a way to get more reading done while doing some other stuff, but I know I don't like it compared to reading. 
* Is it warm enough to read outside? Or do cardio outside even? The extra sun can kinda help regulate your brain with sleep times. Avoid this if it's -30 there, save your lungs.
* How deep are you into language learning? The listening bit is more passive, so if you have the base you could try combining it with something like washing dishes? However languages are very mentally tasking to process so, don't expect to do anything intensive with it.

&gt;2-3hrs instead of the 6hrs?

Honestly even 2-3 tasks. Like Monday you do study / cardio / reading. Tuesday lift weights / language learning / maybe tiny review of studying. And so on. If your doing this all daily, that's a lot. 

&gt;No I don't, but I don't know how to control when I fall asleep, I've never in my life been able to do that.

I also have severe issues getting to sleep ~~although mine stem from brain refusing to shut off.~~ I found various sleepy YouTube playlists helped me and some other people mentioned sleep story podcasts. It's def a your mileage may vary thing, maybe try going into a weekend to see? 

( Either download the video or use some kinda ad blocker for YouTube and sleepy music. Loud ads suck. )

Weighted blankets supposedly help people fall asleep. Mine didn't make a huge change, but it's comfy so was worth the sale price.

If legal there, supposedly pot helps. I have not tried that but friends say the oils are best for doseing for bed and the dispensary is usually good at having options. 

Also possible over the counter option, melatonin can help trigger your body to go to sleep but isn't suggested long term. Might try for a week and see doctor if it works to find out better solution. Not over the counter if your Aussie tho.

Again, might wanna look at some of the sleep subs if falling asleep is also your issue.

Also for sleep apena possibility, I still vote ask doctor about sleep in general but have [symptom list](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-apnea/symptoms-of-sleep-apnea) I found. Short version is, if you have it (I do it sucks) your body keeps not breathing at night randomly causing you to basically never get REM sleep and sometimes actually wake up. Usually solved by giving you a machine with a small nose mask that gentley pushes air at you all night so your body won't do that. I won't lie and say I'm great about keeping up with the mask, but it does help as annoying as it is. 
 
&gt; Unless I put a coffee machine in my bed or something.

Well if you live alone and have a coffee maker, you could probably try moving it onto dresser and putting a cup there.

If it gets you up and out of bed, who cares if it's kinda wierd. Plus if you need creamer your now leaving for the kitchen. 

Again, maybe a weekend test. 

&gt;Good point, I'd have to get google home or something though.

My province was giving rebates to people who installed those. Worked out to $30 out of pocket. Try googling your area and energy efficiency rebate programs. 

If you own a heated blanket some have timers?

For apps,

Sleep as Android is pretty good, if you have one. Smart Wakeup is the REM sleep option in there. Has an option for annoying puzzles to solve on wakeup under captcha. Useable for free but the lullabies and syncing with sun lamps / wifi lights / that sleep blindfold with lights is one time cost.

Sleep Cycle I know exists, unsure of quality but seen it before. 

Alarmy is that really annoying alarm one. There was an app literally called 'I can't wake up!' that takes all the alarmy tasks and makes you do many of them. 

Also if you haven't, screen dimmer apps might help. I use Flux on PC and whatever Androids default is on phone. Flux also has the benefit of a non intrusive popup of you are waking up in 9 hours which will usually have me like shit right getting ready for bed. 

I really wish you luck dude. This sucks. You deserve sleep and time to do all the things you want to. 

Also fuck I should go to sleep actually.",1642660808,htffwdg,GetStudying,2022-01-20T06:40:08Z

"I'm going to give you a simpler example, and you can extrapolate from there. 

I had a customer that wanted to change a coffee maker. Not safety critical in any way, right? And both part numbers were aviation rated, compliant to DO-160 tests for all sorts of stuff. Meaning they are both valid options. Both weigh the same, so we didn't have to worry about the weight in the compartment we were putting this into. 

Seems pretty straightforward, right?

Except they aren't the same size. The existing machine was bolted to a track in the compartment to slide it out. The new machine couldn't align with those tracks, so the tracks had to be removed. We couldn't find other tracks that were suitable (and customer wanted a drawer) so we designed a slide out drawer, and got a lovely stress analysis for the weight of the machine on that drawer panel. Install the drawer, install the coffee maker. Drawer needed to be latched in place when not used; research and select a part for that. 

We had to reroute the drip pan drain line to make it all fit. 

Coffee makers are hardwired. All new wiring had to be designed and a new connector selected. Probably was a bitch for the installer, the disconnect was pretty far away. 

We had to compile flammability test data to show the drawer met regulatory requirements for that. We had a stress report for the drawer and the compartment doors. 

We had to come up with and conduct an electromagnetic compatibility test where all critical aircraft systems (and many/most) passenger amenities) were tested to show there was no interference when the machine was run. 

Collect all that data, document it, send it to the firm representing the regulatory agency, get it certified. Took a few months to get parts, have the plane come into the shop, then installed it. 

Whole thing took about a year, start to finish. 

For a coffee maker.

"The phantom. Next to its sister ship, the Krait Mkii, the phantom seams like the wrong decision. Fewer hardpoints, fewer internals, less cargo space, weaker shields and armor, no fighter bay. They even forgot the coffee maker. But there is one thing where the phantom shines brighter than an high metal content world a dozen lightseconds from an O class star: exploration. All of those other decisions by Delacy make sense in this context. They weren't making a worse Mkii, they were getting it as light as possible for higher jump ranges. With a slot for a nicely sized fuel scoop, guardian FSD booster, and a decent shield, the Phantom can take you anywhere you want to go with room to spare, unlike some explorers I could mention. SRV bay, AFMU, a spare cargo rack and a S&amp;R limpet load out, the phantom can carry it all to the deepest corners of the galaxy. Engineering isn't needed to get you on your first expedition. Not every landing spot is so Krait, but as a medium ship, the phantom is still a lot more maneuverable and versatile than one much more expensive exploration option out there.

The phantom, like her sister, also offers one of the most gorgeous form factors and cockpits in the galaxy, and certainly one of the best looking ones far from the bubble of humanity. Don't be intimidated by the large wings flanking you, the position still allows for gorgeous views of any world you scan or land on. The landing gear allows relatively easy access with SRVs, and flat nature of the phantom allows for gorgeous screenshots, giving you the option for a broad side side covering your screen or a sleek line slicing down the picture. And what else is to be said about the main thrusters? That line of glowing exhaust makes every picture in realspace look truly like a true adventure. The sound of acceleration in this beauty is the sound of oncoming adventure as you rise from a rocky body after after surface mining, charging your FSD for the next 30+ lightyear jump into the unknown. 

And the best thing, unlike some lesser ships with multicrew capability, the Phantom keeps you front and center, your view uninterrupted by support beams in front of your face.",1642642347,htee7dx,EliteDangerous,2022-01-20T01:32:27Z

"I had this happen to a coffee maker. No matter how much I cleaned, how well I cleaned, etc, I would see multiple kinds of these in and around my kitchen.

One day I go outside to have a cigarette and notice that my neighbors below me keep opening and closing their door. Going they were moving out, I went to the other side of the stairwell to see what was going on. He had a late 90s model Dodge Dakota. The bed of it was heaping above the roof of the can with trash bags and there was garbage all across the lawn, including a formerly white used surfboard from his other half. It smelled horrible and there were bugs crawling everywhere.

I spoke with the office about it and they got the bug people to bomb, which did no good because they don't use an igr. 3 months later the same thing was happening in my apartment and maintenance came by let them know they either fixed it or move out. Another truck full of nasty. It happened a third time and then they took the garbage out when there were 2-6 bags and I was able to get done gentrol and borax to keep them mostly at bay.

So it can happen. If the bugs get overpopulated then they get into the walls and look for a place to start a colony. Someone from the office called CPS on my neighbors who visited for a year because these two had a 1.5 year old daughter.",1642640941,hteb32f,WTF,2022-01-20T01:09:01Z

"None of these are your standard brewed coffee but as many comments have already said, the closest thing is an Americano.

I know you‚Äôre just getting into coffee, so here‚Äôs a very ELI5 primer on coffee:

When it comes to making coffee, there‚Äôs a few things you can adjust to change the flavor of the coffee. 

First is the roast. In other words, how long and at what temperature do you roast the beans. You‚Äôve no doubt heard of light roast, medium, dark. These are just different ways of saying how ‚Äòcooked‚Äô the bean is.

Secondly you have grind size. When you have a coffee bean, you can grind it finely or coarsest, or anywhere in between. Fine grind has more surface area that is in contact with water. That can be good or bad depending on your brew method.

Thirdly you have brew method. Common ones are drip, French press, pour over, and under pressure (aka espresso).

Fourth, you have water temperature during brew.  A lot of people use boiling water because it‚Äôs easy, but many coffee connoisseurs will use slightly cooler water.  You can Google this and end up spending a lot of time watching videos where coffee nerds debate optimal temperature.

Fifth is time.  That‚Äôs to say the time that the water is in contact with the ground beans.  Less time usually means more acidity. 

Now, many of these go hand in hand ‚Äî for example, for espresso, you‚Äôd want to use a fine grind at 200¬∞ with a ~30 second extraction time.  For French Press you may go with 205¬∞, three minute extraction time, coarse ground.

So when you‚Äôre talking drip coffee, I‚Äôm thinking  about the stuff you get from Mr. Coffee coffee maker with the glass carafe that uses those white paper basket filters. Or similarly what you get from that iconic glass Bunn carafe that seems to be in every single diner in America.

But this cafe doesn‚Äôt have that. They have an espresso machine and are extracting the coffee under pressure.

So an espresso is a roughly one ounce ‚Äòshot‚Äô of concentrated coffee. Basically the same amount of coffee that you‚Äôd use in a standard 8oz cup of joe, but with far less water.  So it‚Äôs really strong.

An Americano is this same shot of espresso and diluted with hot water.  So it has roughly the same coffee bean to water ratio as regular coffee.  But it went through a different process which means the flavor is going to be different. Not objectively better or worse necessarily. Just different.  Better or worse depends purely on your preference

Fun fact: it‚Äôs called an Americano because during WW2, when American soldiers went to Europe, the espressos were too strong so they diluted them with water. Either mockingly or endearingly, this diluted drink was called an Americano, and the name stuck.

Also in the menu is have a Cafe Latte. It‚Äôs an espresso shot plus steamed, foamy milk. Similar is a Flat White which instead uses steamed, but not foamy milk.

So TLDR: none of the items on this menu is a standard drip coffee but the closest is the Americano. Also don‚Äôt listen to any supposed experts that tell you a particular drink is garbage or an abomination or anything like that. Drink what tastes good to *you*, not what is ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to taste good).",1642628893,htdi7u1,Coffee,2022-01-19T21:48:13Z

"My insurer said that was the ‚Äúnext best‚Äù option to having the original receipts. Since a lot of my guns were bought long ago/private, I didn‚Äôt exactly have the receipts to show and chose to go another route. 

Any LGS that buys firearms should be able to price them for you. Simply say ‚Äúit‚Äôs for insurance, I‚Äôm not interested in selling‚Äù and they should give you the market value instead of what they would offer if you looked to sell it to them.  

In lieu of both of those things, you can (and what I did) is just give the insurer the general price point that you paid for it or what the ballpark on current market value is.

Insurers have massive lists for common items that are claimed and updated every so often by whole teams of people whose sole job is to scour the internet/retailers to compile a median price on items, everything from typical stuff on claims (toaster, coffee table, coffee maker, etc.) and if you claim an item and the value they give you is lower than what you paid/it‚Äôs worth IIRC you yourself can do the legwork and provide it to the insurance company and they‚Äôll usually take that into consideration. 

For example on when it would be in your favor: item claimed was an ‚ÄúAR-15 rifle‚Äù. Well, the median price for all of the hundreds of variants/manufacturers of AR‚Äôs is probably only $450 bucks. If you give the manufacturer, model, and serial to your insurer (before the claim of course) and they come back with the $450 but yours is actually worth $1000, going online and finding examples where yours was sold/is currently selling (gun broker, Buds, etc.) should easily reverse their decision in your favor. 

Anecdotal example but I went through something very similar with a car I had totaled a few years ago, they quoted me the base model but mine had an upgraded trim. I didn‚Äôt even need to provide proof, I just said mine has x trim and had these features and their payout went up in my favor. They told me it‚Äôs pretty much the same for everything in insurance, and the more back up you have, the more likely it is to get the actual value.",1642623009,htd238o,guns,2022-01-19T20:10:09Z

"When I was homeless and relying on food banks with my allergies (milk and coconut) before I knew I couldn‚Äôt also have gluten, I lost 20 pounds a month. I quickly dropped 70 pounds from starvation in about a few months and tons of people kept telling me, ‚ÄúYou look so good! You lost so much weight!‚Äù Even my doctor at the time told me to ‚Äúkeep up the weight loss‚Äù and asked me how I did it, which I said, ‚ÄúStarvation.‚Äù And clearly they weren‚Äôt listening since they said, ‚ÄúGreat! Keep it up!‚Äù 

When I went to the food bank, I got four cans of chicken noodle soup to last me for two weeks. They wouldn‚Äôt accommodate my dietary needs since they didn‚Äôt have options to give me. And they couldn‚Äôt give me more foods (the four cans I could eat) since they only have so much food they can give to each person. And a lot of their foods require a stove or microwave to be able to cook which I didn‚Äôt have access to that often. Then since I have a milk allergy, most of the foods also required adding butter or milk which I couldn‚Äôt do since they didn‚Äôt have milk free options at the food bank. 

Most nights I fell asleep hungry. My hair kept falling out in clumps. I was exhausted. I felt weak. I often got heart palpitations. 

Those same four cans of food I couldn‚Äôt have today since the noodles in the soup were made with flour‚Ä¶ One of my greatest fears is becoming homeless somehow again and then not being able to eat anything from food banks again and starving. The hunger I remember so vividly and terrifies me still.

When I did have food stamps it was better since then you can buy what foods you could with what money they allotted to you. I preferred food stamps over food bank any day. 

When I couldn‚Äôt get food stamps nor get access to a food bank from lack of transportation, I had a job at the time where I set aside $15-$20 a week for groceries. I usually bought peanut butter, a loaf of bread (before I knew I couldn‚Äôt have gluten), almond milk, vegan butter, and ingredients to make pancakes and cakes. I found making pancakes was the cheaper option at the time and they were very portable, pretty flat, and could be eaten with your hands cold. I rarely bought meats, snacks, juices, or desserts. Sometimes I bought tortillas if I had extra money and lunch meat and spinach. But this was rare. I also would buy multivitamins and vitamin D since I have a deficiency. 

There was a time where for two years I only could cook in a coffee maker. Then I only made noodles with marinara sauce, chicken noodle soup, hot dogs, and brewed broccoli or other veggies in the coffee brew basket. 

When I lived in poverty I often didn‚Äôt eat every day. I ate once a day at most or every two days at the least. Sometimes I only had a few spoonfuls of peanut butter and took multivitamins. 

It was difficult. Especially if you don‚Äôt have access to transportation, being able to get to food banks can be impossible. Then you‚Äôre exhausted from being so hungry and thirsty so it‚Äôs hard to walk longer distances to even try to walk to a food bank. It felt like a non stop cycle of BS. 

In college my academic advisor when he saw me would ask me when the last time I ate was, then I was trying to think about it to remember and he was like, ‚ÄúIf you have to think about it, it‚Äôs been too long.‚Äù And then he‚Äôd insist on buying me something to eat from the school supply/book store.

"&gt; Though Paul Carlson just fixed a Keurig by injecting a square wave on top of another square wave to correct the duty cycle of the latter square wave, though I don‚Äôt completely understand how that works (I thought the Keurig would see a combined signal and freak out). ‚ÄúMr. Carlson‚Äôs Lab‚Äù on YouTube.

I can explain that. The thing is that the main coffee maker board counts how fast the water pump goes by counting the amount of pulses (or rather: the amount of times the signal goes from low to high) in a certain time, say a second. (Note it's purely the frequency that counts here, not the duty cycle. It's signal edges per second.) It uses that to regulate the speed of the pump. The issue was that the calibration of that process was messed up, and even at very low speed, the controller was like 'whoa, so many pulses, that pump is running at a breakneck speed' and slows it down to a snails pace.

One of the solutions is to speed the pump up is to make the board think it's actually going slower than it is. As the board measures the speed as signal edges per second, you would do this by making it receive less signal edges per second than the sensor actually generates. You still want your generated signal to be proportional to the actual signal, though, so the control logic still can regulate the pump speed, but you want proportionally less edges so the control logic regulates up to a higher pump speed.

There are multiple ways to do that, but Mr Carlsons solution simply surpresses the signal 60% of the time. (I think he buried the lede on that one a bit: it seems that the control circuit he created actually forces the sensor signal to be low when active, and passes it through unregulated when not active i.e. it has an open-drain output) So when the pump runs for 20mS (I think his control signal ran at 5Hz), the sensor signal will be passed through for 12mS, (the 'high;' and the control board counts those edges. For the remaining 8mS, the signal is forced low and the board can't count edges. The net result is that the control board only sees 60% of the edges, and as such will regulate the pump speed to be 60% faster to compensate for the now seemingly slower pump.",1642556265,ht9cyms,AskElectronics,2022-01-19T01:37:45Z

I (28M) have been seeing my girlfriend (31F) for a little over a year. We've been official since May '21. Things are generally serious and we discuss having a future together casually, but aren't planning things formally.

My lease is up in March and I'm currently in the worst living situation of my adult life. My landlord steals from me (perishable things like booze, food, weed, etc.) and most of the household appliances (coffee maker, pans, blender, toaster oven) are mine and generally disrespected by my roommates (using knives to cut things on my pan, not cleaning things, etc.). In short, I want to get the fuck out. 

Currently, GF and I are about a 15-25 min drive apart depending on traffic. I am in the final steps of signing a lease, which will be closer to 25-40 min drive apart. We live in a fairly expensive area (near DC). GF thinks this increased distance will ruin and potentially end our relationship. She also thinks I didn't consider her feelings and should have found something closer to her.

My roommate to be, however, works in the oppose direction of her home. Anything closer to her is 1) more expensive 2) farther commute for him.

GF thinks ITA for not recruiting her to hunt more or conferring with her before settling on a place. I've been pretty open the entire time I've lived at my current spot to options she could find, but she didn't really present any (and it's not her role to do so, but I won't say no to help). I even let her know where we were touring before scheduling them. She wasn't thrilled at the time, but seemed understanding. Now, she thinks I just disregarded her feelings and is on the Doom and gloom train.

I feel like keeping it within a 25-40 min commute was being considerate. I get it's not close, but we spend the whole weekend together from Friday night to Monday morning (at which point I drive home before work). I don't see it meaningfully affecting our time together. She disagrees. 

Rent is exponentially cheaper if I went even farther from her and would be even more convenient for roommate to be. But I had a hard stop on anything which would require upwards of 40 min to see her, even in bad traffic, I've told her this, but she didn't agree that was an example of my being considerate. So AITA for not considering her opinion more on the move?

"What do I think?

Thanks for asking.

Firstly, coffee is a staple,like flour or sugar in an American kitchen.

Having a wall mounted coffee grinder was something held over from the 1800's in many of the kitchens ""out west"" and even affixed to hoosiers.

So anything coffee is likely not going to go out of style anytime soon.

Is the built in coffee maker overkill?

Yes, but then again I don't have pockets deep enough to hire an architect, let alone ask for a $5k unit. So I would have a stand alone unit for my beer budget even if I do have champagne tastes.

Speaking of, having worked in the service industry, you have to give the customer what they want. If they want this, fine. But, it is great to ask *why* and, how to really incorporate this into their lifestyle. As a designer, things can look great, but the realities of running plumbing, electrical have to figured out. As well as maintenance (what if it breaks? How to make it easily serviceable? Access panel(s) socabinets aren't destroyed just to get at a connection, etc.) Also, being a designer, you can point out how models change, and if they ever went to upgrade, they could be stuck with this model being built in. Not that you're suggesting a counter top cheap thing, but instead, want (the freedom) to design a coffee/tea nook, something that fits their lifestyle, has the option to grow and change, yet looks great. (And is resellable, instead of that 1970's cabinet can opener.) Commercial kitchens can have specific use areas with plumbing, but the good ones allow for serviceable maintenance and upgrading to new units. Designing that right isn't cheap, but worth paying for the service.",1642541986,ht8e0qq,Coffee,2022-01-18T21:39:46Z

Building is on West 142nd Street between Broadway and Riverside Drive. ALL utilities, communal home/kitchen supplies (toilet paper, paper towels, tissues, cleaning supplies, k-cups, salt, pepper, olive oil, spices, etc.), and monthly housekeeping included in rent.

60-unit pre-war elevator building with live-in superintendent and card-operated laundry in the basement. 5 min walk to the 1 train at 145th or 137th, 8-10 mins from the ABCD trains at 145th. Key Foods and Food Universe within walking distance, Whole Foods one subway stop away (or a 10-15 min walk). 5 min walk to Riverside State Park. The area has awesome food/drink spots - Dinosaur BBQ, The Grange, The Cloak Room, The Chipped Cup, Harlem Public, At The Wallace, Oso, Honeywell, Uptown Bourbon, Hamilton Hall, Oh Craft! Beer, L‚ÄôArtista, ROKC Ramen, FUMO, The Chick Inn, Espresso Matto, lots more opening up all the time - this neighborhood is BOOMING.

The entire apartment overall is about 1000 sq ft. Tons of exposed brick and natural light throughout the day. The bedroom faces the street, with a lovely Hudson River view. The room size is 12‚Äôx16‚Äô with a 10' ceiling (huge room). Large closet, high ceiling, currently holds a queen bed but can easily fit a king and still have room for a desk and side tables. Bedroom comes unfurnished with AC unit.

Common area will be as-is and fully life-ready, with cookware, dish set, coffee maker (and supplied k-cups), countertop dishwasher, large-space AC unit, 4K television, etc.

Continuing roommates are two men (ages 26 and 30), both active professionals who have dynamic schedules but keep the home as a haven for unwinding and communing.

Ideally we are looking for someone more long-term who is LGBTQ+ friendly, and self-identifies as a tidy person.  We are also very conscious about CoVid and take measures to ensure all roommates feel safe. We are both very easy to get along with, trustworthy, and respectful of the shared spaces, so we wish to find a third individual with the same mindset.

February 1st or March 1st move-in date. $1400/month. Rent includes unlimited electricity, water, gas, super-fast wifi, home supplies (never argue over toilet paper again), and monthly housekeeping for shared areas. First+security required.

"Not sure if you are asking why drip coffee, the specific method of making coffee, or the history of coffee in America.  


Personally, on occasion, I'll have a cappuccino and macchiato, but I find myself drinking them within a minute or so and am now craving the taste of coffee. Most of the time I'll make myself an Aeropress and if I'm out and don't trust the coffee shop, I'll see if they have any tea. My tea taste isn't discerning as it is for coffee. I miss Melbourne and Sidney, 9 of 10 coffee shops (not 7-11, Macca's, etc) offered and made a good pour-over. I can see the appeal of a flat white or another espresso drink but still would order a pour-over.

Regarding the method of production, with a good-quality drip coffee maker, you can get pour-over quality coffee. However, By the time you've purchased a Moccamaster, you could have purchased a V60 or Aeropress, a kettle, a hand grinder, and a scale (the last two you would 'need' anyways) for less. Most restaurants and homes just want volume and caffeine at a cheap price to the point it's obnoxious at times. Do other coffee drinking countries enjoy coffee, or just want caffeine the way American's do? I love explaining to people that darker roast = less caffeine. 

Regarding history, others have stated what I would have guessed, the Boston Tea Party.",1642522830,ht6xyb2,Coffee,2022-01-18T16:20:30Z

AC pulls too much power on the compressor start up and pops the circuit before the wires have enough time to heat up and burn out. Same with a toaster and a coffee maker turning on at the same time pulling too much power on undersized wires causing the breaker to pop before the wires go. 
Regardless it's dangerous and they should just get the proper sized breaker and wires but we don't know enough context behind the question to know why they're asking the question.",1642516002,ht6gxj5,electricians,2022-01-18T14:26:42Z

For beans, I just buy from the supermarket. I‚Äôm all about good value, so I will buy several bags when I see them on sale. I‚Äôve also ordered beans online when the price is right. When travel was an option, I would even pack 1/2 my luggage with beans from abroad. Any whole bean coffee will be better than anything pre-ground. Coffee capsules are pre-ground (and an unnecessary environmental pollutant). 

I never buy pre-ground coffee. Once the coffee beans are ground, it begins to lose its essence, so only grind what you will use. Sure preground coffee is easier and better than instant coffee powder, but I don‚Äôt trust pre-ground coffee since there‚Äôs always the possibility that pre-ground coffee isn‚Äôt 100% coffee and can contain adulterants and other nasties:

It's like an electric drip coffee (Kreurig), minus the electric part. You need to boil the water separately, buy coffee powder separately, and then let it drip (YouTube will be way more helpful on how to do it). Takes \~5 minutes more to boil the water, but it's the same coffee.

You save on electricity, plastic (no disposable coffee pods) and those last a lifetime because they're made of stainless steel. 

I bought one for myself recently after two years of instant coffee powder from the grocery store. There's a coffee powder shop nearby. I go there with my own box (a plastic container in which I bought my oats once), and make the guy there fill it in that. 

I bought some bands some 5 years ago (workout bands), and the shop gave me a cloth bag to carry them. I still use the same bag for my grocery runs.

"I agree 100% with the previous 2 replies.

I was having a debate on the AirBnB subreddit with someone who thinks I am unreasonable for expecting guests to sweep the floors.

I expect the dishes to be washed, I am ok if they are left in the dish rack, counters wiped off and stove wiped off and floors swept garbage and recycling in the appropriate bin.

I pay my cleaner to clean the appliances inside and out, scrub the bathroom, clean the toilet, replenish supplies from the supply cupboard.  Beds are stripped and made up, floors washed, walls spot cleaned, cobwebs removed (cabin is beside the ocean in a forest, spiders happen).  Countertops are bleached, wood stove cleaned out (rarely used in the summer) fire laid if I rent in the off season.

I have had this conversation with others from time to time.  My cleaner's job is not to tidy up after you, you are responsible for leaving the place tidy.  ie: you sweep the floor, she mops it.  You wipe up your toast crumbs or coffee grounds from the counter, she moves all the appliances, empties the toaster's crumb tray and cleans the carafe of the coffee maker.  You take out the garbage, she cleans the garbage can and leaves it with a fresh bag for the next guests.  Her job is to make sure it is clean and ready for the next guests.

"OHHHH THIS CONTEST! üòç 

I‚Äôve been replaying fallout 4 lately, and I‚Äôve slowly been turning my kitchen red, so I‚Äôm all over this! 

I recommend going with the same brand for major appliances to keep the reds the same shade. 

[Elmira](https://www.elmirastoveworks.com/northstar/ranges/colors/) has nice reds and super cool retro feel. I‚Äôve always liked how [Smeg](https://www.smeg.com/us/aesthetic/50s-retro-style) fridges look too. 

For more minor appliances, I found [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0887SB8FS/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_i_0YA6DQFJ5FT7PNATB5EW) bundle that has a microwave, coffeemaker, and toaster. Or there‚Äôs [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WFHZ8RM/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_i_QPCARVKQXAQ90RYABK21?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1) guy that‚Äôs a coffee maker, griddle, and toaster oven all in one. 

Of course, you will need all new [utensils](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01INYV29M/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_i_Q63ERTWAZ1JTSHQ2S9TM) and a [crock](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VNGWY3D/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_i_0CC8AEAM9970Z7MZMMN8) to store them in next to the stove. Sidenote - I would TOTALLY buy that crock myself if I didn‚Äôt have one already. I just found it looking for you and I really like it! 

For some decor, [these](www.etsy.com/listing/755525259) nuka cola caps would be super easy to hot glue magnets on, and use them for fridge magnets. Or glue a tac on the back if you have a corkboard. Or if you want some pinup art, you could get one of [Hancock](www.etsy.com/listing/474538499) üòÇ that shop has a bunch of different fallout pinup styles that are pretty cool looking!

Two days later he buys me one just because I ""seemed so excited about it"" and it wasnt even mine. That's love. That's something some people would give anything to have, that kind of love.

I(21f) am a chronic migraine sufferer. It has gotten better, and I probably only get one once a week, sometimes even 2 weeks, but when they comes on they will stay for days at a time and I can't eat, sleep, anything really. The only relief I have discovered is caffeine. A doctor recommended it for cheap relief, and as a safer alternative than getting prescribed heavy pain meds. I really does help when paired with over the counter pain meds and can make the difference between a debilitating migraine for days to a bearable headache for hours.

Because the migraines come on so suddenly I buy the premade ice coffee and espresso so that way I can just start chugging immediately instead of waiting for coffee to brew. I keep a lot in the fridge usually. We have been snowed in where we are now. I went to the grocery store beforehand so it's fine, but this morning I woke up and I noticed my coffee had seriously depleted over night. I had 3 full bottles, but there were only 1 full bottle and a half full bottle left.  

My roommate and I have pretty much a ""what's mine is yours policy"" usually when it comes to food(with a few exceptions) and we don't really care what we eat of each others, but usually we stick to our own food because we don't have similar tastes, but my roommate knows why I stay stocked up on coffee and we are still getting snowed in and are under a severe winter weather advisory until 2 days from now, and the roads probably won't be safe until Friday - Saturday. So if we run out of something I can't just drive out to the store to get more(I drive a little 2WD honda). 

At first I tried to calmly ask her how she had drank so much, and she just said she made herself a few ice coffees the day before. I asked her why she didn't make herself some coffee with our coffee maker instead, and she was very dismissive and just kept telling me to calm down. I just kind of blew up because my rm knows about my migraine issue and also knows I buy that coffee specifically to help me treat it. She told me I was an AH because I can't ""express myself in a calm and mature manner,"" and just told me to make coffee in the coffee maker and put it in the fridge.

"Many, many years ago I worked for a VAR and went to this large local insurance agency in a huge, rambling old house in a residential neighborhood. They had three critical services: Netware 3, MAS90, and some nightly batch upload via modem. Of course these were on the the crappiest PC's imaginable-- I distinctly remember there being a Packard Bell-- stuffed into a literal closet with no ventilation, and plugged into a single surge suppressor I wouldn't trust to protect a coffee maker. The box with the modem had also been pressed into service to run PC-Anywhere and send faxes. I think there were three 8-port hubs, actual hubs, chained together networking it.  My boss knew the owner personally and just shrugged.

I told them they needed to take a back up of everything, put a good UPS on each box, get an air-conditioner, replace the cascade of hubs with a switch, fix the wiring while they were at it, move the remote access to its own box and firewall it, and then think about upgrading the ""servers"". My boss did the quotes. They didn't do anything.

A couple months later hilarity ensued. One of the boxes smoked off in the night, filling the office with smoke and the only reason it didn't take out the building was that the fire alarm was heard by a neighbor and they called the owner (yeah, they had battery-operated residential pucks on the ceilings with no wiring into an alarm). *Then* they took all my advice and took a service contract with us. It took several weeks to get them sorted out but follow-up visits were a breeze.

I'm so glad I moved on from that kind of work.",1642441512,ht2a9si,sysadmin,2022-01-17T17:45:12Z

"You‚Äôre not crazy and I would have been upset if I were you too. Quite frankly my bf is like this and we have been together for 5 years. He‚Äôs in med school and has been for 3 years now, and he was an engineer before that, so 2 demanding studies. I would know, since we have been together since he was in college for engineering.  Pretty much after he did undergrad he moved for work and we did long distance. Then he moved back to the same city we went to school in and started medical school there. Ever since he moved back and started school it has been like pulling teeth to get him to spend quality time with me. I have had to beg for months to watch a movie with him or a show, and to go on dates. He recently finished a big exam he needed to take and then shortly after he finished that exam he and I moved in together. For his reward for finishing the exam he wanted to buy himself a Nintendo switch and a nice coffee maker. For the first 2 months after he got the switch he would play constantly and get upset with me when I wouldnt play with him. I told him it wasn‚Äôt really my thing and that I‚Äôd play when he put effort into my planning a date with me or showing interest in any of the things I like to watch in my free time. He also said after his big test (which was in July) that he would take me on more dates. 

The most recent date we went on was our 5th anniversary, which is in late October. I told him I wanted him to plan the occasion since I planned the last 4. He told me he was going to take me to dinner and find an activity for us to do. Then he told me later that he bought me a really expensive gift, so it might be better to just do dinner and I was totally fine with that. Before dinner he asks me if I want to know what the gift is (there were some shipping delays) and I was super excited so I wanted to know. Turns out the expensive gift he got was the nice coffee maker he wanted. 

I had a good time at dinner but told him the following day that I was unhappy with what he got me for my anniversary bc it was way more of a gift for him. He told me he‚Äôd be better and be better about planning dates, being more romantic, etc. all promises I‚Äôve heard many times before. It‚Äôs now January and he really hasn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs sucks. He got me board games he wanted for Christmas and that was it, even tho he said he‚Äôd get me something else, Christmas was a month again and I still don‚Äôt have anything from him. We started seeing a couples therapist so I‚Äôm giving it one final try, but I have myself a deadline of my birthday to leave, which is in April   If somehow things turn around before then, then that‚Äôs great. I don‚Äôt expect it to tho tbh but I‚Äôm hoping therapy might help. Either way it sounds like we are in a similar situation and what I have been doing was visualizing and making low key plans to leave. Making sure I have enough money to do that, passively looking at new apartments, making conscious choices not to get myself more deeply involved in the relationship (like not getting a cat). 

I think it‚Äôs time we both realize that these men probably aren‚Äôt going to change. Give yourself a deadline to call it quits bc when you‚Äôve been with someone who you love for so long it‚Äôs really hard to leave and to see your life without them. But I know now that I‚Äôm 23 and that‚Äôs still very young. I also know that I have a lot to offer in a relationship and that if he‚Äôs no longer treating me up to my standards, then I‚Äôll find someone else who will. It is simply not worth being in an unhappy relationship where you‚Äôre constantly looking for your partner to prove to you that they‚Äôre worthy of your commitment. If they were worthy, we wouldn‚Äôt have to test them or ask for things over and over again that we are never gonna get.",1642437298,ht1z81o,JustNoSO,2022-01-17T16:34:58Z

"Hey OP,

I saw your app and you're getting some great feedback here on accessibility and usability! I think this covers a lot of the basics, so I'm thinking about marketing and innovation. 

I really like your app as a type of universal tracker that can aggregate metrics into analytics that is more than a fancy pedometer. However you still focus on physical activity and consumption. 

Who is your target audience?  

At first I thought about connectivity with bluetooth enabled smart home appliances to track water consumption from a fridge that dispenses filtered water or something similar to a connected coffee maker, but that sounds like a proprietary logistical nightmare. Though your app could be the first to try it!

Another passive metric could monitor grocery purchases through a grocery store's membership app. It could build a record of the types of food purchased and create some pattern. Similarly, a Starbucks membership could feed into your app for coffee consumed. 

So on and so forth with a gym membership app as well.

The easiest passive metric to gather would be online occurrences. This is something to market towards ""connected"" people who want to monitor trends without the complexity of aggregating it themselves through GA.

So something like,  ""total Twitter hits on my hashtag"" with a semantic map for word association. Stack that with Google hits or ezine mentions. Include Instagram, TikTok, and any other social app. But the trick is to maintain the current interface of simplicity that promotes adoption. 

The SUPER EASIEST metric that ties in a mobile app would be ""time spent at location"". So based on a phone's gps you could designate coordinates as the bedroom, bathroom, work or with proximity to another device. 

Then you can build stories like, ""time spent in bathroom"", or ""time spent in bed"" with a ratio between awake and asleep. Or ""time spent in proximity with another phone"". 

I feel like there's a lot you could do with that. Even go back to the pedometer with ""time spent walking"", or based on speed, ""time spent driving"".

The ""other device"" could also connect to an animal tracker, so you can monitor ""time spent with pet"".

Anyways, good luck!",1642435481,ht1ulbe,design_critiques,2022-01-17T16:04:41Z

The circular shape of the stain suggests that the coffee maker was circular, or at least had a round base.

"Begin with your WHY and find your motivation. Ask yourself why and then follow up with ""and what would that give me"" and continue on asking yourself this duo of questions to get to the heart of the matter as to what working out in the morning would eventually fulfill for you.

Though I have no little ones anymore, I used to get up at 4.30 AM to be at the gym when it opened at 5 AM many, many moons ago. And the REAL why (though I would have never admitted this out loud then) was that it was the ONLY time I got to myself - my (then - now ex) husband worked 3 pm to 11 pm which meant that I had after school pick up, dinner, homework, and baths for 2 kiddos without any help.

Once you find your real why - that you don't have to admit to anyone but yourself - then go about setting yourself up for success by making it super easy.

Back then, I would set out not only my clothes, but the girls clothes so ex could get them dressed for school. I'd set up my coffee (back then I had an instant coffee mixed with some milk already made for when I got up. And I made sure lunches were staged, too. AND, I'd have my bag ready and by the door (since I would then shower and go straight to work from the gym)

All that to say: being a parent is hard work so make it as easy on yourself as possible by setting up as much as you can for yourself and your kiddos before you go to bed.

These days, I stage a week's worth of workout clothes in my closet and put them on as soon as I get up.

Like others have said, plan your workouts ahead of time - use that stack to your advantage. So, if you know you need a warm up before a ride, add that to your stack. And if you really enjoy an instructor, opt in for a live early class to also motivate you.

I keep basic accessories in our workout area: cold water in a thermos, sweat towels, Bluetooth earbuds, and extra socks along with our shoes (I keep a pair of regular shoes as well as my cycle shoes) so that everything is THERE once I walk into our gym area.

I DO drink a cup of coffee (set up the coffee maker the night before) as well as have a glass of water before I workout and go to the bathroom one last time before I get on the bike.  And if I get on the bike within an hour or so of getting up, I don't eat. 

Research shows that the best way to build a solid routine like this is to use habit stacking: a series of small steps when put together give you a bigger habit/routine and support. So play around with all the little tips people are sharing and find what works for you to stack small little acts that help you get the results you want.

Last, but  not least, if you aren't a morning person, don't beat yourself up, I DO workout as early in the day as possible but then I have always been a morning person. DH doesn't even want to think about working out until noon or later.",1642427042,ht1c2vq,pelotoncycle,2022-01-17T13:44:02Z

Also, for clarity, they were using the same spreadsheet for work orders, invoices and shop orders. So copy to your desktop, do whatever job you do, then save to file server as ""work order 123"" ""shop order 321"" ""invoice 213"" or whatever.

But what if the AI would do some predetermined routes and then do some random routes on top of that, but the game would always communicate where the AI is going to go with clues. 

For instance, a security guard might move back and forth between a desk and a window, but then a phone rings, and you know that the guard will be moving to the phone. A coffee maker makes a ping, and you know the guard will move to that. Another AI comes by and says something to the guard, and you know the guard will go to him.",1642414701,ht0ubpx,gamedesign,2022-01-17T10:18:21Z
"What? That large triceratops over there in the corner? That's our CPA / book keeper / AP / AR / work order / helpdesk / CRM dinosaur. We have no idea what he eats or how to keep him healthy. Is that even a him? What do female triceratops look like...

I got a call in the mid 00's similar to yours. Audit, advise. Manufacturing company. Niche industry. 50 ish workstations. Every last one is Win95 (a decade old at the time). There's a file server running Novel Netware 3.something. It's actually on a UPS. Shockingly, when I checked uptime, it was around 1700 days. Okay, color me impressed.

The COO is that guy who knows enough about tech to be utterly disastrously dangerous. He assures me they're fine as he manually runs weekly backups (ouch) but they totally don't need them because the file server has a RAID array (I wring my hands together rather than face palm myself). COO demonstrates the backup. It's an IBM tape drive being fed by some software on the Netware machine that I've never heard of much less seen before. When I ask COO, have you restored from a tape before? I get the expected ""what? no? why?"" Then how do you know they work? I can tell from the look on his face he has never even considered this, so I push it. ""What is the plan *when* this machine fails? How do you get that data from tape to a replacement machine?"" I get the expected ""but it won't fail because RAID"" and we have a quick discussion about what RAID is and is not. For good measure, I include fun details about the near ever present issues when trying to boot from an incomplete RAID array. To really sock home my point I asked COO, ""Can you even buy a replacement server with Netware 3.something and this style of IBM tape drive?"" (I knew the answer to this question)

All of this was before COO showed me their work order and inventory management system which was a single enormous Lotus 1,2,3 worksheet. Everyone who used it would copy it to their desktop from the file server. Do whatever. Occasionally forget to ""save as"" and overwrite the ""master"" copy - because of course everyone had full rights to the single worksheet gluing the entire company together, right? COO was VERY proud of his worksheet. Guess who wrote it? Yeah.

It was a 1/2 Mb file back in the days when 1/2 Mb meant something. Thousands and thousands of lines of ... I won't even call it spaghetti, I like spaghetti, dogshit code. I spent a couple hours going over it until the headache was too much. The macro names, function calls and procedure names made no sense. A huge chunk of them (there were hundreds) were seemingly random 4 characters. Some would give you a hint, okay this one is WOTY, uh, that's work order something something, right? They were also often times needlessly self-referential. There would be a macro whose sole job was to call another macro. This happened everywhere. As if for every cell that had to call ""WOTY"" there'd be a new macro that just called the other macro. I felt like I was having a stroke.

The thing that really sunk in and really hit me as I'm looking at this company. 50 in the office, about 200 in the plant and I know, I mean I absolutely know to my core, every single one of these people's jobs is hanging on this trash fire of a ""system"" they're using. 250 families are one power cycle and boot failure away from looking for another job. That was the point I really tried to press to the CEO when I gave my analysis. That and ""What do you do when COO quits?""

I've been doing one kind of tech or another about 3 decades now, but that was easily the most uncomfortable situation I have ever seen. Oh, that Netware server, sitting next to the front office reception desk. Right next to the coffee maker. Any one of the dozens of people who came though there every day could have kicked the power cable, dumped coffee on it, whatever, and everyone's out of work.",1642414336,ht0tvih,sysadmin,2022-01-17T10:12:16Z

"One year we got a pod-based coffee maker. Both my wife and I are big coffee drinkers. Initially, we were paying about 75 cents a pod at our corner store, then 66 cents each at grocery chain. Got it down to about 42 cents per pod at a big box store. We were still spending about $100/month on coffee. Tried the re-usable pod with ground coffee but found it messy.

Then we heard that Keurig had manufactured it‚Äôs one billionth pod and they mostly were going into landfills.

We gave our Keurig away and got a high end drip maker and a coffee grinder. We buy a can of coffee for 7 dollars that lasts a month, and we buy and grind fancy beans on the weekends and still only pay about 20 dollars a month for what I think, is arguably better coffee.",1642403386,ht0ffyv,PersonalFinanceCanada,2022-01-17T07:09:46Z
"I've gotten back on the coffee (espresso particularly) but limit my consumption to just one a day, followed by a black tea in the afternoon as a pick-me-up. Interestingly, I found that once I started coffee up again, the regular drip coffee maker seems to give me headaches. I've gotten pounding headaches from regular and even decaf coffee out of that thing, but not my espresso maker, which makes me wonder if there's a chemical in the plastic of the bad coffee maker that triggers headaches sometimes. 

Incidentally, my headaches overall have seemed to improve. I don't know why really. I've gone from getting them once just about every week to once every 2-4 weeks which is way more manageable. Granted I still get a less severe headache in the same problem area about once a week that tends to last hours, however it doesn't seem to escalate as much to the full on throbbing, severe migraine like attack as often. 

Again, I don't know what's changed exactly. I'm back on a bit of coffee, haven't changed what I eat, I still drink alcohol regularly, so I don't know why I've seen some improvement. I've continued taking 250mg magnesium at night and 400mg Vitamin B2 in the morning which I started about 4-5 months ago, so maybe its taken that long to really have some effect. 

Oddly enough, this improvement began after I got a covid booster. I actually had a fever-induced headache from that for a day, and then one of the migraine like headaches the following day which I thought the fever might have caused. But since then I've noticed a sudden improvement. Its pretty strange, but welcomed.",1642397988,ht06sv0,migraine,2022-01-17T05:39:48Z

"I take your point on antibiotics specifically, but ultimately I think the preceding century was a bigger jump in terms of the experience of the everyday. And actually, infant mortality starting decreasing pretty steadily from the early nineteenth century onward. One of the biggest forces ever in the decline of infant mortality wasn't antibiotics or vaccines, but public sanitary sewers. The nineteenth century brought us modern water treatment and sanitation, and nothing in the world before or since has been more important for public health. Another nineteenth century innovation, pasteurization, may be up there too. 

Industrialization was absolutely a revolutionary change for common people. It sent people rushing into cities, changed the relationship of our lives to our work. In fact, it created the very notion of a distinction between work time and off time. Prior to the industrialization nineteenth century, the notion of work days or not work days wouldn't have made sense. We also got electrification, which absolutely changed the rhythm of our days in unimaginable ways. 

Relatedly, nineteenth century travel and communication were bigger jumps than the now, and in fact revolutionized our experience of time. The railroads in fact invented unified time, which didn't legally exist in the US until the early twentieth century. 200-100 years ago brought telegraph, telephones, transoceanic cables and transoceanic steamliners, the birth of commercial air travel, the birth of radio, a unified international postal system. Before, most people lived in little bubbles, and meeting strangers was a rare occurrence. The hundred-year period in question brought an explosion of international leisure travel and immigration, and facilitated people moving further from their families. 

In contrast, i live in a prewar building in nyc. It's over 100 years old, and yet it's still using most of the same technology as when it was built (though my landlord is at this point keeping the boilers running with duct tape and bubblegum). I don't own a microwave, or a coffee maker (French press ftw), or even have a washer/dryer in unit. None of this changes my daily experience much when compared with friends. I recently got a blender and am enjoying smoothies for desert, but that doesn't ultimately change my experience of being alive all that much. 

In short: I think telegraph, telephone,  movies, and radio combined were much more important for changing our way of life than was the combination of all of the things into a smart phone, and they were also a much larger leap technologically.  Antibiotics, while perhaps one of humanity's greatest achievements, still didn't save as many lives as water and sewage treatment and pasteurization.",1642360483,hsxpc2f,insanepeoplefacebook,2022-01-16T19:14:43Z

We broke up last month and we bought this coffee machine a month before we broke up. I paid for all of it and it was around $700 and he picked it out. I am not much of a coffee drinker and he used to use it. 

He was moving out last week and he wanted to take the coffee maker with him and I told him that he needs to pay me $350 for it. He got upset but he did end up giving me the money for it before he moved out. 

He did say that it proved that I was petty, materialistic, and selfish just like my parents and it hurt me a lot because I didn't realize how fucked up my parents are until he pointed it out. I feel guilty because I know that he doesn't make as much money as I do and it must have been hard for him to budget for money especially as he as to get his own place. I don't need the 350 at all.

"Milk first is just straight up wrong; tea wants \~95c water to brew properly. A few want slightly cooler water, but 85c is the absolute minimum. Milk first, you're going to be bringing the temperature down toward the lower end of that range immediately, and you'll have to beat the shit out of the tea bag to get a remotely acceptable brew.

Coffee, on the other hand, should not touch water above 80c. Milk should always go in before the water with coffee if you're using a kettle and a press, or some other similar manual method. If you have a proper coffee maker which regulates the temperature, then adding milk after is preferable to have more control (or if you froth your milk, you *need* to add it after).",1642337784,hsw8ye3,CasualUK,2022-01-16T12:56:24Z

"From Wikipedia:

The moka pot is a stove-top or electric coffee maker that brews coffee by passing boiling water pressurised by steam through ground coffee. Named after the Yemeni city of Mocha, it was invented by Italian engineer Alfonso Bialetti in 1933 and quickly became one of the staples of Italian culture.[1][2] Bialetti Industries continues to produce the same model under the trade name ""Moka Express"".

I had never heard of Moka before. TIL",1642307676,hsv271r,mildlyinfuriating,2022-01-16T04:34:36Z
"Ultimately I will most likely get down voted again even though I am working on owning my own coffee shop. But here are some reasons why a moka pot might give a sour or bitter taste.  
‚Ä¢ How you clean it is really important. I never use soap and water to clean out anything. I typically use sea salt and a paper towel to clean out the coffee stains. Soap can change the taste of your coffee even if you feel you washed it all out. I also will brew white vinegar with water through the pot without any grinds to make sure I killed anything that might want to try to grow. Then rinse it out with some clean water.  
‚Ä¢ The type of water you are using can change the taste of your coffee. I get laughs but I use bottled water in both my moka pot and espresso machine because hard tap might have too much lead, or copper, or chlorine, or fluoride, or calcium. To a basic coffee maker that might not be too much of a concern and I do not judge anyone for that. But for me knowing my water is the same every time helps me dial in my method on making a great cup.  
‚Ä¢ Moka pots are not espresso makers. I feel a lot of people tend to think they are a stove top espresso maker but that is not true. They make a strong cup of coffee but it is not espresso. So when you use grinds in it. Don't go too fine or you will create too much pressure in your pot and stop the water from pushing through coffee making the pressure valve release the steam pressure used to brew. That said, what you might use in your basic pour over, french press, or espresso maker might not be the best coffee for a moka pot. This is where I will get down voted. I still with a lose medium grind in my moka pot. This is for two main reasons. If you run too much of a dark roast the carbon and coffee bean will break off and end up in your cup. A medium grind will prevent that. A fine grind can clump up and clog the moka pot. Something between medium and fine is the best choice.  
‚Ä¢ Depending if you roast your own beans or you buy already roasted/grind your storage might be an issue. I always keep my grinds in the fridge. This prevents moisture from getting in and causing mold growth and slows the bacteria that might want to eat the tasty coffee which gives it a musky taste if you let it sit out. I found using a Mason Jar with a latch style lid works better than anything else for this. I also find using a little rice made in a paper towel packet on the top of the lid helps keep out extra moisture that might make the grinds taste weird.  
‚Ä¢ People will say the temperature you bring the water too will effect the taste. And they are right to a degree. You do not want to scold your coffee with boiling water. But you do want to bring your water to the thresh hold of creating more atmospheric pressure inside to push the water up. 100C to 110C is ideal. But if you have a stove that you cannot control the heat. I use a kettle and bring the water to a boil. Then let the kettle sit for a minute or two. Fill the chamber up in the moka pot then with oven gloves on close the pot up and put it on my smallest burner at a very low heat. Reheating the water will take less time but you will be able to get a more consitant pressure to brew at. Plus the kettle will boil out anything extra in the water if you are using tap water.  


I would say though if you don't want to get that deep into it. Try a different brand of coffee switch from a dark roast to a medium or light roast. Switch from Colombian to French Roast or some house blend. Don't be like most coffee snobs so stuck up in chasing the perfect cup of coffee you turn your nose to the simples solutions working out better.",1642307280,hsv1fz5,Coffee,2022-01-16T04:28:00Z

"Have you walked into a hardware store recently? There are so many much more egregious examples of useless packaging. 

I don't own, nor would I own, a pod coffee maker. But you'd have to be an imbecile to not realize that they are contributing to our excessive waste stream. I didn't need a professor, a government department or a court to tell me that. But so what? There are unlimited examples of excess non-recyclable waste in our society.

The irony is the pods are actually recyclable in BC where the complaint originated as well as in Quebec. That actually means they are recyclable everywhere it's just that some provinces choose not to bother.

If you look closely, you will actually see that much of what goes in your blue bin ends up in a land fill anyways.

Not sure why this case garnered so much attention, but it's bullshit through and through. Should never have made it as a legitimate investigation and certainly should have never ended up wasting court time.

The only things I think you really need that currently can‚Äôt be placed elsewhere are the toaster, utensil jar, coffee maker, and maybe the mixer but that model is pretty light so can be put away. Take down your mounted wire junk holder. Put the cutting boards away. Can‚Äôt tell what your wooden box is next to the sink, but I don‚Äôt think you need to store that there. Get a drying mat if that‚Äôs not what I see there already and put it away when not in use. 

I think there‚Äôs a few things you can do to expand the space you do have if you‚Äôre open to suggestions on that. (Sorry if you aren‚Äôt!) Consider pulling the table out towards the fire place and add a kitchen island that has storage space. Or, maybe you can get a small buffet for under the window. You could use it for storage and/or turn it into a coffee station and move your coffee maker over there.",1642299454,hsuk5qm,DesignMyRoom,2022-01-16T02:17:34Z

"Yeah, um, no. The system is not ""broken"". In fact, I'll go so far as to say *you* are ""broken"". Now, hear me out. Part of the system is your saying this from the sidelines. It's just part of things, and altogether, taken in the broadest view, it forms a system. You're the ""letting off steam in reddit"" part of the system.

Now, what I will suggest to you is that the system is *ill-constituted* from the ground up. Your concept of ""broken"" assumes a pre-existing system that is basically OK, but it got broke. Like a broken coffee maker. And that is where and why you, in turn, are broken, though no fault of your own, I'd guess.

"&gt; Chuck is the one employing him to pick up his groceries, so Chuck is the one that is able to determine if the groceries are wrong

He‚Äôs able to determine that he didn‚Äôt get what he wanted but from what we know it‚Äôs not even Chuck who writes the list; Jimmy gives it to Howard. More natural explanation is that Chuck got used to his brother knowing what kind of apples he likes and didn‚Äôt think he‚Äôd have to explain it to the new guy. Either way, the show doesn‚Äôt specify, but while Ernie is not shown to be especially forgetful, Chuck is shown to be extremely defensive and incredulous about his mistakes. 

&gt; He doesn't hassle Kim to get him coffee. He asks her if she might as he can't work the coffee maker

She‚Äôs an associate at a Big Law firm, not a cater waiter, not his friend. Not sure what your professional situation is but I‚Äôd find that insulting, doubly so if the guy ignored what I‚Äôd said to him ten seconds ago 

&gt; Chuck has a respectful conversation about their field 

I mean he indulges a star struck 3L for thirty seconds lol it‚Äôs not hard to be pleasant to your worshippers 

&gt; He calls Lance a halfwit after Lance is clearly lying to him and has suddenly changed his story to help cover up Jimmy's actions

That reflects on his ethics, not his intelligence. Before snatching the money he pauses to identify the potential difficulties with doing so. Then he stands up to the grilling of a trained litigator, even putting him on his back foot. That doesn‚Äôt say dummy to me. So why ‚Äòhalfwit?‚Äô Why ‚Äòidiot?‚Äô",1642291031,hsu0b35,betterCallSaul,2022-01-15T23:57:11Z

"&gt; The show doesn‚Äôt confirm that Ernie gets anything wrong, only that Chuck thinks he does.

Chuck is the one employing him to pick up his groceries, so Chuck is the one that is able to determine if the groceries are wrong.  There is nothing to suggest Chuck was mistaken.  We also see him give pretty explicit instructions, meanwhile Ernie didn't even bother to write anything down until it politely suggested to him.  Why would the show spend anymore time to confirm that Ernie got his groceries wrong?  Ernie isn't that interesting of character that we need to see a scene of him picking up the wrong apples or whatever.

&gt; hassling Kim to get him coffee

He doesn't hassle Kim to get him coffee.  He asks her if she might as he can't work the coffee maker.  While, slightly patronizing with his concern about Jimmy corrupting her Chuck generally shows respect for Kim.  

Look at the Oscar Pool flashback where Kim, Jimmy, and Chuck all talk after he won his big case.  That is during a time when Chuck is at the top of the world: he is happily married, a named partner at a prestigious firm, and just won an extremely impressive case.  Meanwhile, Kim is still a lowly law student that is working in the mailroom.  Chuck has a respectful conversation about their field with Chuck even willing to share his spotlight by allowing Kim to show off her legal smarts.  Mind you all this is vastly more respectful than how Jimmy was treating her in the scene.

&gt;calling Lance a ‚Äòhalfwit‚Äô when he really has nothing to base that on

He calls Lance a halfwit after Lance is clearly lying to him and has suddenly changed his story to help cover up Jimmy's actions.  It isn't like Chuck came into to get copies but didn't have the right amount of change and suddenly started calling Lance a halfwit for refusing to still make his asked for copies.",1642290047,hstxxds,betterCallSaul,2022-01-15T23:40:47Z

Last time I brought a closed cell foam one, I've since upgraded to an inflatable [Sea to Summit Ether Light XT](https://www.rei.com/product/152803/sea-to-summit-ether-light-xt-insulated-rectangular-sleeping-pad). Pricey but I also camp, so I don't recommend this if it's just to sleep on the plane obviously. There are cheaper options out there. I probably wouldn't bring closed cell foam next time because while cheap, it's also bulky and annoying to pack. 
* Some friends of mine bring disposable cameras which is a neat idea
* Packing cubes, dry bags, and a mesh laundry bag. Just makes life easier if you're packing up and moving around country a bunch. 
* Extra ear-pro
* Good concealed carry holster if it makes sense for what you'll be doing (I don't like the issued holsters)
* Maybe an old school iPod jam packed with music and a portable speaker? Depends what you're doing, that's something I remember wishing I had. Maybe some audiobooks. I did a fuckton of driving my last deployment.

"Copying the comment about mine I made on another post a few days ago:

This is the one I bought: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0768TW123/ref=cm\_sw\_r\_apan\_glt\_fabc\_PQPN99GNDMFTGDN5PQN3?\_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1  
  
It is slightly more expensive now (I paid $124). I've had it a year and it has held up well. It seems like all of this type of distiller are pretty similar in construction.  The cons are things like, the on button technically engages a sort of safety switch that only shuts off when it overheats. So you can't shut it off again (though I just unplug it) and it only stops when it's boiled the reservoir dry.  It's also pretty large, it looks a lot like a coffee maker, but it's much larger than that.  
  
The glass pitcher that collects the distilled water is pretty crappy.  It just doesn't pour well, and the handle is held on with metal bands. But when I received it, it was clear that this was done because they could  save money by packing the picture inside the distiller. It seems that most of them of this type have this type of pitcher.  
  
It takes about 4 hours to make a gallon. I just started keeping the nice sturdy plastic gallon milk jugs our milk comes in to store the distilled water (since they were sturdier than  The jugs distilled water usually comes in and have screw caps), so I usually just run it over and over again to fill my ten or so containers,  then put it away until I use that up.  
  
What I'm amazed at is how much crap is left at the bottom after distilling only a gallon of water, and how bad it smells!  It's just gross to think of all that in my water, though I'm sure it's mostly just minerals. We have hard water.",1642282494,hstflid,CPAP,2022-01-15T21:34:54Z

I say get one they are very affordable and though people mistaken them with espresso they work better than the coffee maker if you really want taste of your roast.
