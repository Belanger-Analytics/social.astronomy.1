Pipows,"This is cool, but it give me a little fear of planet of hats. At least it is better than the usual all-races-are-the-same",1643289275,hufnhrq,1,worldbuilding,2022-01-27T13:14:35Z
soccerpuma03,"I got into Hunt after playing Escape From Tarkov. I'd say they have a lot of similarities, but Hunt is far less punishing, takes way less time to understand and learn, and is far more casual friendly. Both games are incredible and I recommend both, but I've personally found myself having way more fun in Hunt. 

EFT also doesn't have the cool hats ðŸ¤ , but if you ever do want to dip your toe into a game with a similar play and feel of Hunt I highly recommend.",1643289125,hufn6xg,1,HuntShowdown,2022-01-27T13:12:05Z
HolographicScoundrel,"You should emotionally give up on the project. The project has functionally already failed. It will fail if these idiots don't shape up, and you can't make them.

You should also start looking for another job. Fuck this. Life's too short, and if this culture is wide-spread you will never succeed there.

You could gather the data and explained to these ass-hats' boss that the project is fucked unless they listen. Don't bring up sexism or ageism. Just make it clear that money will be lost and the boss will look stupid. But you might want to just keep your head down until you have another source of income. 

You don't have a responsibility (or the ability) to save these idiots from blowing themselves up. Emotionally and physically distance yourself from the situation.

On your way out, you can tell HR why you're leaving.",1643289124,hufn6vi,1,Healthygamergg,2022-01-27T13:12:04Z

Wearing hats isn't as big in Europe.",1643289038,hufn0zy,1,AskReddit,2022-01-27T13:10:38Z
deadcactusman,"Level 15 here. I currently only have:

&amp;#x200B;

* Rococo Pearl Crown
* Zulu Hats
* Cathedral Veil
* Festival Halo
* Halfpenny Unveiled
* Olive Leaf
* Peacock Crown

I feel like I could use a 'dark' HA or headscarf/headwrap, but overall I have no idea on what to get. Any advice?",1643289033,hufn0ni,1,Covetfashion,2022-01-27T13:10:33Z
